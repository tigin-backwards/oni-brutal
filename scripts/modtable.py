"""scripts/modtable.py [CATALOG.tsv] > docs/MOD_COMPATIBILITY.md
The compatibility table from onimaxxing's catalog ranks (a TSV of rank, id, subscriptions, flags,
title; default scripts/mod-catalog.tsv) and what our runs recorded.

The catalog TSV comes from onimaxxing's catalog.json (format 2, column arrays): a mod's rank is its
place among all the catalog's mods by subscriptions, most first (a stable sort, so ties keep the
catalog's order); its flags are analysis.breaks (crashesAtStartup, mayCrashInPlay), else
notLoading, else empty ("unanalysed" for a mod the catalog has no analysis of). Ranks 1-750 are
all there, flagged ones included. Beyond 750 the TSV holds only the mods that work in the
original as far as onimaxxing knows: those flagged notLoading, crashesAtStartup or malware are
left out, down to the rank (2274) where the mods kept, ranks 1-750 counted too, make 2000.
Every rank in the TSV is listed in the table (LAST_RANK is its highest).

What our runs recorded:
- the load sweeps of scripts/mod-sweep.py, tests/e2e/sweeps/*.tsv (or ONI_SWEEP_RESULTS): per mod
  whether it fails in the original, and if not whether it fails in ours, at the main menu or in
  the colony; a later file (by name) overrides an earlier one, and these override the older
  sweeps below;
- the older sweeps' sweep-*.txt ID lists and modtable-*.tsv results in out/ (or ONI_SWEEP_DIR; in
  a worktree whose out/ has none, the main checkout's out/);
- the spec results in tests/e2e/results/*.json (or ONI_RESULTS_DIR), written by
  `scripts/e2e.py --record`: a record's verdict and note decide the Played column, ahead of the
  hand-written status sets below, which stay for mods no spec has played yet."""

print(f'''# Mod compatibility

Which Workshop mods have been tried in this player, by popularity in
[onimaxxing's catalog](https://onimaxxing.com/mods): the {FULL_RANKS} most-subscribed, then down to
rank {LAST_RANK} those the catalog flags neither as broken (not loading, crashing at startup) nor
as malware, the 2000 that work in the original game by the catalog's analysis; and mods players
reported.
Worldgen mods are played with functional expectations (their worlds generate with their content),
not identical layouts.

**Columns:**
- **Loads:** reaches the main menu with no error of ours.
- **Colony:** loaded with its batch of about 25 mods and played 90 seconds of a Spaced Out colony,
  with no error of ours: U57 (late game) for ranks 1–500, 2minnow (mid game) from 501.
- **Played:** a save played with the mod, its screens and logs compared with the original player.
  ⚠️ means played with a small known difference, its issue linked.

"No error of ours" means no error that the original player's log lacks. ❌ means the mod fails the
same way in the original player (it needs an update from its author). Every run uses the
Workshop build of each mod, installed as a local mod (the closest to a subscription; Dev-folder
installs get developer checks subscribers never see).

| Rank | Mod | Loads | Colony | Played | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
''' + '\n'.join(rows) + '''

## Known differences

- **Particle features no game data uses** (collision, lights, noise, clamp velocity, sub
  emitters, some shapes) are not simulated, and are logged; mods' effects (Capsule 2.0) look
  simpler.
- **LineRenderer:** rounded corners and caps are drawn square.
- **A mod class missing a method of a game interface** (built for an older game) loads, as on
  Mono; where Mono fails as soon as the game checks the class against the interface, ours fails
  only when the missing method is called (ARCHITECTURE D22).
- **A game class's nested type a mod names that the game no longer has.** Mono binds it to the
  class's last nested type when something listed that class's nested types before (its log says
  "TypeRef ResolutionScope not yet handled") and fails it otherwise. The game lists those of its
  strings (STRINGS) before it loads mods, and ours binds a missing one there as Mono does
  (ARCHITECTURE D32: U&F-Translate Fix); elsewhere ours fails it, where Mono binds it only after
  something (a mod's reflection, say) listed the class's nested types.
- **Transpilers on Unity's UI code** (uGUI, TextMeshPro) are not supported: they need the exact
  IL of Unity's builds, which ours does not have. Ordinary Harmony patches on those classes
  work. Text Input Hotkeys transpiles TMP_InputField.Backspace.''')
