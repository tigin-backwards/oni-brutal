# U60 review: overlay tweaks

`fast-overlays` and `fast-overlay-textures` against U60 (761015, public test), from Klei's
decompiled game code (U59 = `aa9baa00`, U60 = `4a63c523` in oni-versioning, paths under
`OxygenNotIncluded/`) and the U60 assemblies. Static review and a U60 compile only: no player ran.

Short version: Klei's U60 rewrite of the overlays does what each part of both tweaks did, or
removes what it patches. Before this review, turning `fast-overlays` on under U60 would have
stopped the game starting. `AccessTools.Method(Mode, "AddTargetIfVisible")` throws
AmbiguousMatchException (U60 has four overloads), and the type initializer throws (the
`OnTemperatureOverlayInfraredUpdate` delegate and the `layerTargets` field ref). Both tweaks now
check for the U59 shape of each target. On U60 they install nothing and log why. They are retire
candidates, to retire after the U60 perf measurement.

## `fast-overlays`

| Part | Game members touched | U60 change | Verdict | Runtime check on a U60 player |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Power | `OverlayModes.Power.Update` (prefix, finalizer); `CircuitManager.GetWattsNeededWhenActive` (prefix, postfix); assumes Power.Update asks each circuit once per building | Power.Update now collects the targets' `IBridgedNetworkItem`s and fills a pooled `Dictionary<ushort, CachedNetwork>` once per circuit before tinting (OverlayModes.cs U60 2320 `CachedNetwork`, 2510–2530; U59 asked per building at 2449). GetWattsNeededWhenActive itself now uses pooled sets and dictionaries (CircuitManager.cs U60 622–700), with the same results | Retire candidate. Klei now caches per circuit; the part would never hit a kept answer. Left out when `OverlayModes.Power+CachedNetwork` exists | Log has `fast-overlays: power left out`; the power overlay's frame time with the tweak on equals off |
| Temperature (infrared) | `Infrared.Update` (prefix); `TemperatureOverlayInfraredVisualizerBase.OverlayInfraredUpdateDispatcher` (static field replaced by reflection); `OnTemperatureOverlayInfraredUpdate` (delegate); `TemperatureOverlayInfraredUpdate` (delegate); assumes every visualizer subscribes to Game event -880408538 and tests its transform against the view bounds | Visualizers no longer subscribe to Game's event. They join a `visibleVisualizers` set on their controller's `ControllerVisibilityChanged` (6106694, KBatchedAnimController.cs U60 932; TemperatureOverlayInfraredVisualizerBase.cs U60 73). `Infrared.Update` calls `UpdateAllVisible`, which colours only those (Infrared.cs U60 105; base U60 127). The colour is kept per visualizer (memo, base U60 146–158). The dispatcher field and `OnTemperatureOverlayInfraredUpdate` are gone (U59 base 11, 35) | Retire candidate. Klei now skips out-of-view visualizers without reading them, which is what this part did. Left out when the field or the handler is missing | Log has `fast-overlays: temperature left out`; temperature overlay frame time on equals off |
| Targets (materials, decor, plant, pipe, conveyor, power, automation, exosuit) | Transpiler on `ConduitMode/Crop/Harvest/Decor/Logic/Power/SolidConveyor/Suit.Update`, `TileMode.Update`, `TileMode.TryAddObject` rerouting calls to `Mode.AddTargetIfVisible<T>` (7 params, ICollection), `Mode.RemoveOffscreenTargets<T>` (4 params, ICollection), `Mode.UpdateHighlightTypeOverlay<T>`; reimplements those and `ClearOutsideViewObjects`; calls `Mode.ResetDisplayValues(KBatchedAnimController)`; prefix on `TileMode.TryAddObject` reading `TileMode.layerTargets` as `HashSet<PrimaryElement>` | All targets are `HybridListHashSet<T>`, walked as lists. `AddTargetIfVisible` is split into four overloads; the core tests the extents and then `targets.Contains` before the fog-of-war walk (OverlayModes.cs U60 2255–2308). `RemoveOffscreenTargets` / `RemoveAndResetOffscreenTargets` test `Extents.From(item)` and no longer read transforms or the world id (U60 2035–2101). `UpdateHighlightTypeOverlay` is gone (U59 2133), replaced by `RemoveOffscreenAndUpdateHighlights`, one walk that removes and highlights (U60 2124). `TileMode.TryAddObject` is gone (U59 3475); its replacement `AddPrimaryElement` tests `layerTargets.Contains` first (U60 3620–3622), as the tweak's TileMode prefix did. The tweak's unused KPrefabID lookup is gone from the game's RemoveOffscreenTargets | Retire candidate. Its targets are gone, and Klei's rewrite dropped the allocations, the second walk and the late Contains. Left out unless all U59 helpers (with ICollection parameters), `TryAddObject` and a `HashSet<PrimaryElement>` `layerTargets` are present. The transpiler now throws when a patched method has no call to reroute, instead of patching nothing | Log has `fast-overlays: targets left out`. Then profile `RemoveOffscreenAndUpdateHighlights` and `TileMode.Update`: each still reads `transform.GetPosition()` and `TryGetComponent<KBatchedAnimController>` for every target every frame. If they are hot on a large base, the kept-row idea (fixed buildings' positions and controllers) could be ported to them |
| Verify report | `OverlayScreen.ToggleOverlay(HashedString, bool)` (prefix, ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY only) | Signature unchanged (OverlayScreen.cs U60 180); modes are registered in OnPrefabInit now, and LateUpdate skips `None` | Unchanged; patched only when some part installed | — |

## `fast-overlay-textures`

| Tweak | Game members touched | U60 change | Verdict | Runtime check on a U60 player |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fast-overlay-textures` | `MultipleRenderTargetProxy.CreateRenderTarget` (prefix, postfix), `MultipleRenderTargetProxy.Update` (postfix); reads `Textures`, `TexturesCopies`; assumes CreateRenderTarget makes new copies each call and drops the old ones undestroyed | CreateRenderTarget now calls `RecreateCopyRT`, which keeps a copy whose size, format and depth still match. Otherwise it hands the old copy to `RenderTextureDestroyer` (`DestroyRenderTexture`, destroyed one or two LateUpdates later), and it destroys `Textures[2]`/`TexturesCopies[2]` when the overlay buffer goes off (MultipleRenderTargetProxy.cs U60 39–57, 79–101; U59 39, 44, 53 made `new RenderTexture` each time). A new `OnDestroy` frees them all (U60 104–119) | Retire candidate. Klei fixed the leak. The tweak would only race RenderTextureDestroyer to destroy the same textures. Left out when `RecreateCopyRT` exists | Log has `fast-overlay-textures: left out`. 100 temperature overlay toggles keep live render textures flat (vanilla U60) |

## Out of scope, needed elsewhere

- `scripts/qa.sh` (verify step) expects reports from `fast-overlays` (its power, kept positions
  and kept targets parts) and from `fast-overlay-textures`. On U60 neither logs a verify report,
  so the step would fail for them until the tweaks are retired or dropped from that list.
- `docs/TWEAKS.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` and `GameTweakNames` describe U57/U59 behaviour.
