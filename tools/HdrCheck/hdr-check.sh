# The HDR check (tools/HdrCheck/README.md): how the original game and Moono reach an HDR-capable
# monitor. Each player in turn opens fullscreen on that monitor at the main menu: the original,
# then Moono presenting through DXGI (the default) and through OpenGL's SwapBuffers (--dxgi off). The monitor is captured in FP16 (dupcap, Desktop
# Duplication) and the luminance of its brightest UI (the white title and button text) printed in
# nits, with the monitor's colour space at that moment (HDR or SDR). Run from WSL in a checkout
# with the Windows player built (scripts/build-windows.sh) and the original's isolated copy set
# up (scripts/original-windows.sh; ORIG_DIR names it). Test runs only: own run homes, the offline
# Steam double; no setting is changed.
#   tools/HdrCheck/hdr-check.sh [MONITOR]      MONITOR: 1-based, as -monitor (default 2)
# ONI_HDR_GAME: the game folder Moono runs (default the installed game); ONI_HDR_ONLY: a list of
