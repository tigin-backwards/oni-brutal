"""Luminance of FP16 monitor captures (dupcap's PFM files: linear scRGB, 1.0 = 80 nits).

    summary.py A.pfm [B.pfm ...]

For each: the median luminance of the frame (the background) and the mean of its brightest 0.5%
of pixels (the white title and the button text of the main menu), in nits. With HDR on, Windows
shows SDR white at the "SDR content brightness" setting; a player that Auto HDR or RTX HDR takes
for HDR content shows its white UI much brighter than the others.
