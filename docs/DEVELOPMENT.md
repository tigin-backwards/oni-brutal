# Development

How to build, run and test Moono from source. If you just want to play, the
[README](../README.md) is all you need.

## Requirements

- Linux x64 with an OpenGL 4.5 driver. The Windows test player is built from WSL (its
  `OniMoono.exe` with the Visual Studio C++ build tools on the Windows side), and runs on
  Windows x64 with an OpenGL 4.5 driver and the .NET 10 runtime.
- The .NET SDK pinned in `global.json` (10.0.402, or a later patch release). The scripts use
  `~/.dotnet/dotnet` if it exists.
- The Linux build of Oxygen Not Included, expected at `~/projects/oni-linux`. To use another
  location, set `ONI_GAME_DIR` for the scripts and tests, and pass `-p:OniGameDir=...` to
  `dotnet build`.
- `python3` and binutils (`as`, `ld`), for the offline Steam stub.
- Optionally `libvpx`, for the one test that compares our VP8 decoder against it. The test is
  skipped without it; the player decodes the game's videos itself.

## Build

```sh
dotnet build OniMoono.slnx              # debug: engine, host, tools, tests
dotnet build src/OniMoono.Host -c Release
```

Both write to `out/bin/<project>/<config>/`. The host's output has everything needed to run: the
engine, BRUTAL's native libraries, and the Unity module facades in `engine/`. The host carries
its own copy of the engine, so after changing the engine, rebuild the host too.

`scripts/build-engine.sh [debug|release]` also lays out `out/engine` (the engine and its facades
without the host), which the API conformance check reads. `scripts/build-packages.sh` builds our
uGUI, TextMeshPro and Timeline into `out/packages`.

Test players and builds run through `scripts/contain.sh CMD...`, which starts them in the
memory-capped systemd user slice `oni-tests.slice` (`scripts/oni-tests.slice`, installed into
`~/.config/systemd/user` when it changes) as preferred OOM victims, so a player that over-commits
is killed instead of your session or WSL. `run.sh`, `check.sh`, `qa.sh` and `e2e.py` use it on
their own; use it for builds started by hand too: `scripts/contain.sh dotnet build …`.

## Run

```sh
scripts/run.sh                 # needs a running, logged-in Steam client
scripts/run-offline.sh         # no Steam: a stub stands in for libsteam_api
ONI_CONFIG=release scripts/run.sh
```

Both scripts keep saves, settings and mods in `out/run-home` (or `ONI_RUN_HOME`), away from your
real profile in `~/.config/unity3d`. Any other arguments go to the host. Useful ones for testing
are `--log FILE`, `--headless --frames N`, `--capture FRAME:PATH` and `--max-frame-rate N`.
Unity's `-screen-width`, `-screen-height` and `-window-mode` work too. An unknown option, such as
`scripts/run.sh --help`, prints the host's usage line with every option.

The player's options come from built-in defaults, then the settings file
`<persistentDataPath>/oni-moono/settings.json` that the main menu's Moono Tweaks screen writes,
then the command line: `--game-tweak exact|all|none|NAME|-NAME` (repeatable; any of them sets the
whole set), `--splash moo|none`, `--frame-stats` and `--log-paths hidden|full`.
`--no-tweaks-menu` leaves the Moono Tweaks button off the main menu, as in the original. [TWEAKS.md](TWEAKS.md) lists the tweaks and their
verify mode (`ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1`).

These runs have no game tweaks and no splash, and log full paths, unless they name otherwise:
the scripts pass `--game-tweak none --splash none --log-paths full` first, so neither the
player's defaults nor a settings file in the run home changes what a test measures. `ONI_TWEAK_SETTINGS=1` leaves that out, to try the
Moono Tweaks screen as a player has it.

`Player.log` keeps its first 20 MB and its last 20 MB or so, cut with a banner between them;
`ONI_LOG_FULL=1` keeps all of it. More diagnostics (`--trace-exceptions`, `--dump-hierarchy`,
`ONI_OBJECT_CENSUS`, …) are in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §7.

The offline stub says you own the base game, with no DLC and no Workshop items. It's for testing
on machines without Steam, not for playing.

## Setup

To play through Steam like a player does, run `./setup.sh` (Linux) or `setup.cmd` (Windows, which
runs `setup.ps1`). From a clone they build a self-contained player first (`setup.sh` into
`out/player`); from a release they use the archive's `player/`, after deleting the `OniBrutal`
and `OniBrutal.*` files an older release extracted there may have left. `setup.ps1` installs the
player into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\oni-moono\player`. Both print the launch options line
(`OniMoono -- %command%`), or say that every Steam account already has it. On Linux,
`ONI_STEAM_SANDBOX=flatpak|snap|none` overrides the guess of how Steam is sandboxed.

## Releases

```sh
scripts/release.sh                     # out/release: the Windows zip and the Linux tar.gz
gh release create vYYYY.MM.DD.NN out/release/oni-moono-*.zip out/release/oni-moono-*.tar.gz \
  --title "YYYY.MM.DD.NN" --notes "..."
```

`release.sh [VERSION]` names the archives by VERSION, by default the date of HEAD's commit. The
tag and title add a two-digit counter for the day (`.01` for its first release), so releases sort
as text. The build compiles against the game's assemblies, so it runs where the game is installed
(not in CI). Each archive holds an `oni-moono` folder with the setup script, the README,
`NOTICE.txt` and the self-contained player in `player/`; the setups install a release's player
without building. Nothing of the game goes into them.

## Windows

```sh
scripts/build-windows.sh       # out/win: OniMoono.exe, Restarter.exe and the Steam stub
scripts/run-windows.sh         # from WSL: a test run on the Windows install
```

`OniMoono.exe` is our native host (`src/OniMoono.NativeHost`, [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
§2), built by `scripts/build-native-host.sh` with MSVC through `cmd.exe` (`VCVARS64` names
`vcvars64.bat` when vswhere can't find it). `release.sh` builds it the same way, so releases are
made from WSL. `scripts/check-windows-host.py EXE [--like OTHER.exe]` checks a built one from its
PE file (the two GPU exports present, writable and 1; the icon, manifest, version and subsystem);
`build-windows.sh` and `release.sh` run it, and `check.sh` runs it on `out/win/host` when
there is one.

The Windows player uses the Windows build's own data, whose shaders include OpenGL programs
alongside the Direct3D ones. `run-windows.sh` copies `out/win` to `%TEMP%\oni-brutal` and starts
it on the Steam install (`ONI_WIN_GAME_DIR` to change that). Test runs stay away from your game
data, Steam account and speakers:
- `--run-home` gives the game its own Documents, AppData and LocalLow under
  `%TEMP%\oni-brutal\run-home` (`ONI_RUN_HOME`)
- the Steam stub replaces `steam_api64.dll` (`ONI_STEAM_STUB` names another one)
- `--audio-wav` writes the game's sound to `fmodoutput.wav` there

To compare against the original Windows player under the same isolation:

```sh
scripts/windows-run-home.sh RUN_HOME SAVE out/bin/PerfProbe/release:-2037174645
ONI_RUN_HOME='C:\...' scripts/original-windows.sh -screen-width 1024 -screen-height 768 -screen-fullscreen 0
ONI_RUN_HOME='C:\...' scripts/run-windows.sh -screen-width 1024 -screen-height 768 -screen-fullscreen 0
```

`windows-run-home.sh` prepares a run home with a single colony, which the main menu resumes on
its own, and mods enabled (`tools/PerfProbe` holds speed 3 and logs frame rates). The original
runs from a renamed copy of the install (`ORIG_DIR`, default `E:\Development\BrutalNotIncluded`)
with BepInEx 6 and `tools/OriginalIsolation`, which gives it the same separate data folders and
audio file. Its first setup copies BepInEx from an existing install (`ONI_BEPINEX_SOURCE`). The
script has the details.

## Testing

```sh
scripts/check.sh               # before every commit
scripts/qa.sh [STAGE...]       # the full harness: unit, dogfood, verify, perf
scripts/e2e.py SPEC...         # end-to-end specs: tests/e2e
```

`check.sh` builds the solution, runs the test suites and the scripts' tests
(`tests/scripts`), and cross-publishes the macOS host. Then it checks the game's assemblies
against the engine's API, and runs the host's type, asset, binding and native checks against the
installed game. Some tests read shaders and fonts from the game, so it needs to be installed.

`qa.sh` runs four stages, all by default: `unit` (the build and `check.sh`), `dogfood` (scripted
play sessions compared against reference captures: menu, new game, colony, every main screen and
overlay, typing, save, load, resize), `verify` (a large colony with every tweak in verify mode)
and `perf` (its frame rate and memory against the reference). `--bless` stores a run's results as
the references once they have been looked at. The large-colony stages need local setup in
`out/local-tools/qa.env`, and are skipped without it. A large-colony run that logs no frame rate
for `QA_HANG_MIN` minutes (default 5) is hung: its stacks go to the stage's `hang` folder
(`scripts/hang-dump.sh`) before it is killed; `ONI_TEST_HANG=FRAME[:spin|wait]` hangs one on
purpose.

`e2e.py` plays a spec (a fixture save, Workshop mods, orders and UI input) in our player, the
original or both, and checks what came of it. Runners in every worktree share lanes (ports and
an Xvfb display each), a players' memory budget and locks in `~/.cache/oni-brutal-e2e`
(`E2E_LOCK_DIR`); `scripts/e2e.py --status` shows them. `qa.sh`'s perf stage writes `perf.wanted`
there, so no new spec starts, and takes `perf.lock` exclusively once the running ones finish;
other perf jobs can do the same with `flock -x ~/.cache/oni-brutal-e2e/perf.lock CMD`.
[tests/e2e/README.md](../tests/e2e/README.md) describes specs, lanes and verdicts.
`scripts/mod-sweep.py NAME` runs Workshop mods in batches through the same machinery, in both
players, and bisects failing batches; `scripts/modtable.py > docs/MOD_COMPATIBILITY.md`
regenerates the compatibility table from the results.

## The OniMoono rename

The internals were renamed from OniBrutal to OniMoono. `scripts/rename-internals.py` does that
rename and is idempotent: run it on a branch from before the rename before merging or rebasing it
onto master. `--dry-run` shows what it would change, and `--audit` lists what still names the old
one and fails on anything not kept on purpose (the lock folder, the Windows staging folder, the
code that recognizes older players).

## Known differences

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §2.1 lists where Mono and .NET, or Unity's player and ours,
differ in ways game or mod code notices (D1–D36), each with how the host resolves it or why it is
kept. The host patches a few game methods (D1, D3, D11, D26), rewrites game and mod IL as it
loads where it depends on Mono (D29–D31 and D47 for both; mods' alone in D22, D23, D27, D28 and
D32), and adjusts the game's Harmony where patches would run differently (D12–D14, D17–D21, D33,
D34, D43).

Float arithmetic in game code rounds as .NET does, not as Unity's Mono (D25); the engine's own
math follows the original bit for bit where that was measured.
