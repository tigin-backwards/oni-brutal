    /// its worker threads and the calling thread. Each Run wakes every worker (a kernel semaphore
    /// released once per worker, 15 on a 16-thread machine), works through the items, then
    /// waits until every woken worker has run, found no item left and checked in, however few
    /// items there were. The main thread calls Run about 14 times a frame in U57 (fetch updates,
    /// mesh batches, amounts, conveyor arms, conduits); waiting on thread wake-ups is much of the
    /// 5.4 ms a frame spent in it.
    ///
    /// The tweak replaces Run with a scheduler of its own threads (as many as the JobManager has
    /// workers, each with the same fixed thread index the work items use for per-thread data):
    /// it wakes only as many workers as there are items beyond the caller's first, through a
    /// semaphore that spins briefly before blocking, and returns as soon as every item has
    /// completed. Each item still runs exactly once, on one thread, and all are done before Run
    /// returns; which thread runs which item was never fixed. A single item runs on the caller.
    ///
    /// With ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1 every run checks that each item index ran exactly once.
