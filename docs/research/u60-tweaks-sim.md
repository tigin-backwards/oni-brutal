# U60 review: simulation tweaks

Static review of seven game tweaks against U60 (build 761015, public test) before a U60
player exists. No game was run. Klei's decompiled source: U59 = oni-versioning `aa9baa00`,
U60 = `4a63c523` (Assembly-CSharp only). The firstpass types (JobManager, the update
buckets, the event system, the cell-change monitor) are not in that repository; they were
compared by decompiling Assembly-CSharp-firstpass from the U59 Linux install and from the
U60 Windows build (`out/local-tools/win761015/Managed`). Line numbers are U60's.

`src/OniMoono.GameTweaks` builds against U60 with no errors and no obsolete-API warnings.

**Result: all seven are unchanged.** Every game member they patch, reflect on or
reimplement has the same behaviour in U60; the U60 diffs in those members are the newer
compiler's shapes (locals split out, ternaries, field initialisers) or the event-system
move, which they do not depend on. None is a retire candidate: Klei's U60 changes do not
touch what any of them speeds up. No code change was needed.

## FastSublimation (`fast-sublimation`)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Harmony postfix `Sublimates.OnSpawn`, prefix `Sublimates.OnCleanUp`; replaces the update loop of the `Sublimates SIM_200ms` buckets through `UpdateBucketWithUpdater<ISim200ms>.batch_update_delegate` (found via `SimAndRenderScheduler.bucketTable` and its entry's `buckets`); reads by name `Sublimates.primaryElement`, `sublimatedMass`, `lastEmitState`, `SimTemperatureTransfer.simHandle`; reads `Sublimates.info` (`sublimatedElement`, `maxDestinationMass`), `PrimaryElement.sttOptimizationHook`, `getTemperatureCallback`, `Element.lowTemp`, `Grid.Mass`, `Game.simData.elementChunks[].temperature/deltaKJ`; subscribes to `GameHashes.TagsChanged` (-1582839653). Assumes `Sublimates.Sim200ms` does nothing but `RefreshStatusItem(BlockedOnPressure)` (a no-op when already blocked) when the item is unsealed, in the same cell, warmer than `lowTemp` and its cell holds at least `maxDestinationMass`; assumes the temperature read is `SimTemperatureTransfer.OnGetTemperature` with its `deltaKJ` copy; `EmitState.BlockedOnPressure == 1`. |
| U60 change | None that matters. `Sublimates.Sim200ms` (Sublimates.cs:158-258), `RefreshStatusItem` (286-311), `EmitState` (28-33), `OnSpawn`/`OnCleanUp` (77-88) are the same; the diff only moves the absorb/split handlers off `IntraObjectHandler` (54-74) and splits a span local (126-132). `SimTemperatureTransfer.OnGetTemperature` (208-223) is the same; `OnPrefabInit` now assigns a cached static delegate `_onGetTemperature` (142), whose `Method.DeclaringType` is still `SimTemperatureTransfer`, so the tweak's check holds. `PrimaryElement.Temperature` (112-122) still calls `getTemperatureCallback`. `Sim.IsValidHandle` only re-shaped (Sim.cs:987). Firstpass: `UpdateBucketWithUpdater` identical; `SimAndRenderScheduler` key format `"{Type.Name} {rate}"` unchanged (only loop locals renamed); `KPrefabID.AddTag`/`RemoveTag` still trigger -1582839653 on every change; `KMonoBehaviour.Subscribe(int, Action<object>)` kept and not obsolete (only the `IntraObjectHandler` overloads are). |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | Run a large colony with `ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1`: the `fast-sublimation: N updates skipped, M run, 0 wrong skips` line every 100,000 skips must report 0 wrong, and the skip count must be non-zero (polluted dirt loose in full gas). |

## FastConveyorPaths (`fast-conveyor-paths`)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Harmony prefix (skip) on private `SolidConduitFlow.TryAdd(List<Conduit>)`, reimplementing it; `MethodDelegate` to the original for verify mode; reads by name `SolidConduitFlow.pathList`; uses `GetSOAInfo().NumEntries`, `GetPermittedFlowDirections`, `Conduit.idx`; verify-mode postfix on `OnUtilityNetworksRebuilt`. Assumes TryAdd's three searches (new path held by a kept one; kept ones held by the new one, and empty ones, removed in order; single-direction shared rails cut from the new path) and that `pathList` is cleared by `RebuildConnections`. |
| U60 change | Semantics unchanged. `TryAdd` (SolidConduitFlow.cs:806-910): the only diff is in the third loop (895-906), where `FindIndex(...) != -1 && IsPowerOfTwo(...)` became nested ifs with locals; same test, same order. `pathList` (539), `OnUtilityNetworksRebuilt` (612-620), `RebuildConnections` clearing `pathList` (625), the single call site in `FindSinksInternal` (803) are the same. Other diffs in the file (`GetNextFlowSource` 395-470, `GetConduit` 1194) are compiler re-shaping. |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | With `ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1`, build and remove conveyor rails in a base with many sources and sinks: each rebuild logs `fast-conveyor-paths: N paths checked, 0 wrong`. |

## OffscreenConveyors (`off-screen-conveyors`, changes behaviour)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Harmony prefix (skip) on `SolidConduitFlow.RenderEveryTick(float)`, reimplementing it; prefix on `SolidConduitFlow.RemovePickupable(int)`; uses `GetSOAInfo`, `Conduit.GetLastFlowInfo`/`GetCell`, `GetCellFromDirection`, `GetContents`, `GetPickupable`, `GetConduit`, `ContinuousLerpPercent`, `KBatchedAnimUpdater.IsChunkVisible`/`PosToChunkXY`, `TransformExtensions.SetPosition`. Assumes RenderEveryTick only lerps each moving item between its source and destination cell centres. |
| U60 change | `RenderEveryTick` (SolidConduitFlow.cs:1017-1040), `RemovePickupable` (1157-1176) and `ContinuousLerpPercent` (554) are unchanged. `KBatchedAnimUpdater.IsChunkVisible` (257) unchanged, `PosToChunkXY` (268) only re-shaped. The U60 cell-change move: `SetPosition` now calls `CellChangeMonitor.MarkDirty(transform, position)`, which sets the KObject's `pendingCell`, and `CellChangeMonitor.RenderEveryTick` updates `KObject.cachedCell` and triggers the cell-changed event (1088554450) on the object; `Grid.PosToCell(KMonoBehaviour)` (Grid.cs:1321-1340) reads `pendingCell`/`cachedCell`. A skipped move therefore leaves `cachedCell` lagging exactly as the transform does, which is the documented behaviour; the final placement goes through the same `SetPosition` and updates it. |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | Watch a conveyor loop off screen, pan to it: items must appear on the rail and continue; an item taken off-screen by a loader/receptacle must land in the receiver with the right position (no items dropped mid-rail on deconstruction). |

## BrainRate (`brain-rate`, changes behaviour)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Harmony prefix (skip) on `BrainScheduler.RenderEveryTick(float)`, reimplementing its loop; postfixes on private nested `BrainScheduler.DupeBrainGroup.InitialProbeCount` and `CreatureBrainGroup.InitialProbeCount`; reads by name `BrainScheduler.brainGroups`; `MethodDelegate` to the abstract `BrainGroup.InitialProbeCount`; calls `BrainGroup.RenderEveryTick`/`PostRenderEveryTick`. Assumes the scheduler's loop is quit/loading check then each group's RenderEveryTick + PostRenderEveryTick, and that `InitialProbeCount` is the per-frame brain budget (also used by `CreatureBrainGroup.PostRenderEveryTick`). |
| U60 change | None that matters. `BrainScheduler.RenderEveryTick` (BrainScheduler.cs:365-376), `BrainGroup.RenderEveryTick` (86-115), the groups' `InitialProbeCount` (172-175, 243-246), `CreatureBrainGroup.PostRenderEveryTick` (278-293), `brainGroups` (307) are the same. The diff only replaces the unused `increaseLoadLabel`/`decreaseLoadLabel` with `tagLabel` (13, 25-29). `Brain.UpdateBrain` lost its Superluminal profiler calls (Brain.cs:30-40). |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | Frame-stats brain updates per frame above 30 fps must drop as on U57 (e.g. 120 fps: Duplicant group about every fourth frame); idle Duplicants still pick up new errands promptly. |

## BrainRateAllowance (part of `brain-rate`)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | None (plain .NET, no game types). Its input is the game's per-frame count from `InitialProbeCount` (Tuning defaults 1 and 5, BrainScheduler.cs:150, 223), still the 30 fps budget stated by `BrainScheduler.framesPerSecond` (305). |
| U60 change | None. |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | Covered by its unit tests; nothing U60-specific. |

## SlowReachability (`slow-reachability`, changes behaviour)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Transpiler on `ReachabilityMonitor.InitializeStates`: matches `ldc.i4.6` (`UpdateRate.SIM_1000ms`), `ldc.i4.1` (`load_balance: true`), call `FastUpdate`, and changes the rate to `ldc.i4.7` (`SIM_4000ms`); throws (install fails and is reported) unless exactly one match. Assumes the `UpdateRate` values and that `UpdateReachability` is only timing-dependent. |
| U60 change | None. ReachabilityMonitor.cs has no diff; `root.FastUpdate("UpdateReachability", updateReachabilityCB, UpdateRate.SIM_1000ms, load_balance: true)` at line 46. U60 IL (ilspycmd -il): `IL_0021: ldc.i4.6`, `IL_0022: ldc.i4.1`, `IL_0023: callvirt ...State::FastUpdate(string, IUpdater, UpdateRate, bool)`, one occurrence. Firstpass `UpdateRate` identical (SIM_1000ms = 6, SIM_4000ms = 7). `MinionGroupProber.IsAllReachable` and `Workable.GetOffsets` now take/return `IReadOnlyList<CellOffset>` (MinionGroupProber.cs:38-70), which the tweak does not touch. |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | The host log shows the tweak installed with no transpiler exception; opening a door to a sealed room makes its errands reachable within 4 game seconds. |

## FastJobs (`fast-jobs`)

| | |
|---|---|
| Game members touched | Harmony prefix (skip) on `JobManager.Run(IWorkItemCollection)` (firstpass), reimplementing it; reads by name `JobManager.threads`; calls `IWorkItemCollection.Count`/`InternalDoWorkItem(i, threadIndex)`; sets `JobManager.errorOccured`. Assumes thread indices 1..threads.Count for workers and 0 for the caller, every item run once before Run returns, and no work item depending on which thread runs it. U60 callers (Assembly-CSharp): FetchManager, GlobalChoreProvider/ChoreProvider (chore collection), ConduitFlow and ConduitFlowVisualizer, AmountInstance, NavGridUpdater, SolidTransferArm, PropertyTextures, SimDebugView, EggProtectionMonitor, CreatureLightToggleController. |
| U60 change | None. Decompiled firstpass `JobManager` differs only in `WorkerThread.ThreadMain` (a local split out); `Run`, `Initialize` (threads `KWorker{i}` with index i+1), `DoNextWorkItem`, `threads` are identical. `IWorkItemCollection` and `WorkItemCollection` identical. In Assembly-CSharp the only U60 change on a line mentioning JobManager, work items or thread indices is `TaskDivision.Run` (for loop to foreach, TaskDivision.cs:31-38); the callers' other U60 changes (e.g. GlobalChoreProvider's storage-fetch tag dedup, 307-341) run on the main thread or inside items and do not depend on which thread runs an item. |
| Verdict | Unchanged |
| Runtime check | With `ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1`, `fast-jobs: N runs checked, 0 wrong` every 20,000 runs; frame stats show time in JobManager.Run down as on U57. |

## Not in scope here

The task named FetchManager, Workable and CircuitManager: none of these tweaks patches them.
FetchManager reaches FastJobs only as a JobManager caller, and U60 did not change how it calls
it (FetchManager.cs: one fetch-amount test changed, 422-434, not job-related). Workable is
reached by SlowReachability only through `ReachabilityMonitor.UpdateReachability`, whose
timing is all the tweak changes. CircuitManager does not use JobManager in U60.
