# The QA harness: exercises what the engine and the game tweaks do, and fails on a regression.
#   scripts/qa.sh [--bless] [STAGE...]        (stages default to all of them, in this order)
# Stages:
#   unit     the build, both test suites and scripts/check.sh (API conformance, type loading,
#            assets, binding).
#   dogfood  scripted sessions through the game, each a scenario (scripts/qa-scenarios, or a
#            scripts/m9-scenarios name): the menu, a new game to embark, a colony's screens and
#            overlays, typing, save and load, a window resize, clicks within one frame. Fails on a
#            log exception or error whose signature the reference lacks, or a capture that differs
#            from the reference beyond the scenario's tolerance.
#   verify   U57 with every game tweak and every engine verify mode, for at least 10 game minutes
#            (6000 frames, six overlays; QA_VERIFY_FULL=1: 10500 frames, every overlay):
#            every check reports zero mismatches.
#   perf     U57 with every game tweak: peak memory under the limit (18 GB on u60; see
#            mem_limit_mb), the steady frame rate no lower than
#            the reference's less 15% (the machine's noise), multi-target framebuffers not piling up.
#            It holds the machine (see quiet_begin): new e2e specs wait for it.
#   memory   (not in the default list; also --memory or QA_MEMORY_ONLY=1, which runs it alone) U57's
#            peak resident memory only, under the same limit: no perf lock, no wait for a quiet machine, and
#            it stops once the first autosave has passed and RSS has settled. It reports the
#            peak, the frame of the peak and the RssAnon/RssFile split (STAGE/memory.json).
# verify and perf need a large Spaced Out colony and its DLC content, which cannot be published:
# out/local-tools/qa.env sets QA_U57_GAME (a game folder with the DLC content), QA_U57_STEAM (a
# Steam double owning the DLC) and QA_U57_SAVE; without it those stages are skipped, and say so.
# It can also export the machine's GL settings for Xvfb (e.g. GALLIUM_DRIVER), which every run uses.
# A U57 run that logs no PERF line (PerfProbe's, every 600 frames) for QA_HANG_MIN minutes (default
# 5; the slowest legitimate gaps are about 140 s of load before the first and 110 s between two in
# the overlay sweep) is hung: scripts/hang-dump.sh takes the managed stacks of every thread,
# per-thread CPU and wait states and the log's tail into STAGE/hang, the player is killed and the
# stage fails, naming that folder. ONI_TEST_HANG=FRAME[:spin|wait] (src/OniMoono.Host/TestHang.cs)
# hangs a player on purpose, to try it.
# --bless stores this run's captures, signatures and frame rate as the references
# (out/qa/reference), once they have been looked at; --bless-from=RUN stores a past run's.
# Players end with qa.sh, however it ends (a `timeout`, ^C, kill -9): each runs in a systemd scope
# of its own that qa.sh stops on exit, and a watcher stops when qa.sh is killed outright (see
# "the players' teardown"). scripts/e2e.py --status shows what runs and who waits for whom.
