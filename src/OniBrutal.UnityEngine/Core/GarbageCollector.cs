    ///   collection first to make room for the budget.
    /// - An explicit GC.Collect inside the region collects and ends it. In Manual mode that is
    ///   Unity's behaviour; in Disabled mode Unity would ignore the call, which cannot be
    ///   intercepted here.
    /// - After either, the region is entered again at the start of the next frame (EarlyUpdate),
    ///   so the mode keeps holding from frame to frame.
