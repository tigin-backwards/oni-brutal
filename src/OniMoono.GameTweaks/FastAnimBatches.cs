    /// the visible batch sets, and each batch with dirty controllers writes, per dirty
    /// controller and in order: its instance data (frame, position, transform, colours: 112
    /// bytes into the batch's data texture), its symbol instance block (into the batch's symbol
    /// texture, when its version changed), then applies its symbol overrides (game code with side
    /// effects: SymbolOverrideController, FaceGraph, the batch's atlases and property block) and
    /// writes the override block. Gluttony: about 1.9 ms a frame on Linux, spent reading
    /// scattered controllers and copying blocks.
    ///
    /// The tweak does the first two writes for every dirty batch beforehand, on worker threads
    /// (one batch to a worker at a time, the main thread waiting), then lets the game's loop run
    /// as before, with those two calls replaced by a check that skips a controller already
    /// written. The override block write, which must follow the controller's own override
    /// application, is answered in the loop (written or not, by the game's own slot test) and
    /// its copy made after the loop, again on workers. Everything else (applying overrides,
    /// texture creation, Apply, which only marks a texture changed, the dirty bookkeeping) runs
    /// in the game's own order on the main thread. Each batch's writes touch only its own
    /// textures and slots, and the controllers registered with it (a controller is in one batch).
    /// What the writes read (frame, visibility, position, transforms, the symbol instance and
    /// override blocks) is not changed by applying another controller's overrides, so writing
    /// them earlier or later gives the same bytes. The engine's transform caches are safe for
    /// concurrent readers. Since U60 a controller's override block is created on first read
    /// (KAnimControllerBase.symbolOverrideInfoGpuData); the loop's own read in WriteOverrides,
    /// on the main thread, creates it before a deferred write reads it on a worker, and only
    /// LoadAnims (never reached from the loop) can reset it.
    ///
    /// Written on the main thread in the game's order as before: batches being set up (Init),
    /// UI batches (their transform reads UI layout), controllers that are not exactly a
    /// KBatchedAnimController, and those whose position comes from a delegate other than
    /// KBatchedAnimTracker's. Frames with few dirty controllers are left to the game. If another
    /// Harmony owner patches any method on the write path, the tweak stays off.
    ///
    /// With ONI_TWEAK_VERIFY=1 each skipped write is redone at its original place into scratch
    /// memory and compared byte for byte with what the worker wrote, the symbol slot's version is
    /// checked against the controller's, a written controller the game's loop never reached
    /// counts as a mismatch, and each override block written after the loop must still have the
    /// version it had when the loop reached it. Gluttony (Linux, stopwatch, steady windows):
    /// 1.92–2.01 → 1.49–1.65 ms a frame; what stays on the main thread is mostly applying the
