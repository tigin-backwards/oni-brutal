    /// real time instead of one batch per rendered frame.
    ///
    /// BrainScheduler updates one Duplicant brain and five critter brains every rendered frame
    /// (its groups' InitialProbeCount, with no time term: its own constants state a 30 fps frame),
    /// so how often each Duplicant re-evaluates its errands, and each critter its behaviours,
    /// grows with the frame rate. A brain update runs its sensors and, when they ask, a chore
    /// search; Moono runs U57 at about 7 times the original's frame rate, so about 7 times as many
    /// a game second (1.4 ms of a 12.6 ms frame on U57, 2.4 ms on Gluttony).
    ///
    /// With the tweak each group may update at most 30 Duplicant brains or 150 critter brains a
    /// second of real time (BrainRateAllowance), spread evenly over frames, and never more than
    /// the game's own count in a frame: at 30 fps or below nothing changes; at 120 fps the
    /// Duplicant group runs every fourth frame and the critter group gets one or two brains a
    /// frame. A frame whose allowance is 0 skips the group altogether (BrainGroup.RenderEveryTick
    /// and PostRenderEveryTick), so the Duplicant group's alternation between its priority queue
    /// and its round robin counts only the frames it runs, and the brains asking for priority
    /// (idle Duplicants, threatened critters) are still served first. A group of a mod's is left
    /// as it is.
    ///
    /// What changes: above 30 fps a Duplicant re-evaluates its errands, and a critter its
    /// behaviours, less often per real second than without the tweak, as often as the game would
    /// at 30 fps (and still more often per game second than the original at U57's 11 fps).
    ///
