# Runs tests/e2e/klei-unreachable.yaml (issue #28) with Klei's servers out of reach for the
# players alone: every proxy variable names a closed local port in their environment (the
# runner's own requests to OniMcp go direct, by no_proxy), and nothing system-wide changes. The
# Steam double hands out an auth ticket, as Steam does, so KleiAccount posts its login: a copy
# of the e2e double (QA_U57_STEAM, from out/local-tools/qa.env) built from the assembly beside
# it (stub.s), with ISteamUser_GetAuthSessionTicket giving four bytes. The original runs from a
# folder of links to E2E_ORIGINAL's, with that copy as its libsteam_api.so. Other arguments go to
# e2e.py, which runs on lane 18 unless they say otherwise. Its runs, references and the original's
# lane folders go to out/e2e-klei/e2e (E2E_OUT), apart from other specs' with the usual double:
#   scripts/e2e-klei-unreachable.sh --player both
set -euo pipefail
source "$(dirname "$0")/env.sh"
# As e2e.py: the environment's values first, else qa.env's.
