# Architecture

This document fixes the shape of the system: what we replace, what we keep, how the pieces
fit, and the rules each piece follows. `docs/PLAN.md` sequences the work. The evidence behind
every decision is in `docs/research/` (`assets.md`, `unity-usage.md`, `runtime.md`,
`brutal-api.md`); section references like *usage §1.3* point there.

## 1. Goal and boundary

Run Oxygen Not Included's **original, unmodified** managed code and data on stock .NET 10
CoreCLR, with Unity's engine replaced by our own implementation built on BRUTAL.

**What "the Unity layer" is.** Unity ships a game as three things:

1. the native player (`UnityPlayer.so`: object system, serialization, renderer, input, …);
2. the engine's managed API: `UnityEngine.*Module.dll` (thin C# over the native player);
3. the Mono runtime and its class libraries (`MonoBleedingEdge`, `Managed/mscorlib.dll`, …).

We replace **all three**: (1) and (2) with our engine, (3) with .NET 10. Unity's packages the
game ships in `Managed/` (`UnityEngine.UI.dll`, `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll`, `Unity.Timeline.dll`)
are replaced too, by this project's clean-room versions of the same names (`src/UnityEngine.UI`,
`src/Unity.TextMeshPro`, `src/Unity.Timeline`; docs/cleanroom). The host never loads Unity's.

**What we keep, unmodified, as game code:**

| Assembly | Why it stays |
|---|---|
| `Assembly-CSharp`, `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass` | The game. |
| `FMODUnity*.dll`, `com.rlabrecque.steamworks.net.dll`, `ImGui.NET.dll`, `Newtonsoft.Json`, `VYaml`, `LibNoiseDotNet`, `Ionic.Zip`, `ArabicSupport`, … | Third-party game dependencies. |
| Native plugins (`libSimDLL.so`, `libfmodstudio.so`, `libresonanceaudio.so`, `libsteam_api.so`, `cimgui.so`) | The game's own natives, P/Invoked by game code. |
| All data files (`globalgamemanagers*`, `level*`, `*.assets`, `.resS`, `resources.resource`, `StreamingAssets/**`, `Resources/unity default resources`, `Resources/unity_builtin_extra`) | Loaded read-only by our asset layer. |

Nothing from `UnityPlayer.so`, `UnityEngine.*Module.dll`, Unity's packages or Mono is loaded.

The reference install is the Linux build at `~/projects/oni-linux` (Unity 6000.3.5f2,
`m_GraphicsAPIs = [OpenGLCore]`). The target platform is **linux-x64**. The Windows player
runs the Windows build's own natives and data, whose shaders carry OpenGL programs beside the
Direct3D ones (§6).

```

**Why facades.** Game IL binds to `[UnityEngine.CoreModule]UnityEngine.GameObject`,
`[UnityEngine.UIModule]UnityEngine.Canvas`, and so on. CoreCLR follows `TypeForwardedTo`, so a
facade named `UnityEngine.CoreModule` that forwards to `OniMoono.UnityEngine` binds every
reference exactly as compiled, while the implementation lives in one assembly with ordinary
`internal` access between subsystems (Unity itself relies on `InternalsVisibleTo` between its
modules; we avoid needing that). The facade sources are **generated** by `tools/FacadeGen` from
the original module assemblies (to learn which type lives in which module) intersected with the
types we implement. A facade `UnityEngine.dll` (forwarding everything) is also generated for
completeness.

**Assembly identity.** Unity assemblies are referenced as version `0.0.0.0`, no public key.
Our facades carry the same names and version `0.0.0.0`.

**Load context.** The game runs in the **default** AssemblyLoadContext, so its `Type.GetType`,
`Assembly.Load` and `AppDomain` queries behave as under Unity. `src/OniMoono.Host/AssemblyPolicy.cs`
resolves names the framework does not provide:

1. Names in the .NET shared framework always win, so Mono's BCL copies in `Managed/` are never
   loaded. Mono class libraries the framework lacks (`I18N*`, `Mono.Security`, …) are refused.
2. `UnityEngine` and `UnityEngine.*Module` resolve only to our facades in `engine/`; Unity's
   originals are never loaded (a module without a facade is one nothing references).
3. Unity's own support packages (Burst, Collections, Mathematics, MemoryProfiler, Profiling.Core,
   Multiplayer.Center.Common) are not loaded: they implement engine features we replace and no
   game assembly references them.
4. Unity's UI packages (uGUI, TMP, Timeline) are this project's (PLAN M9), from `packages/`
   next to the host, never the shipped ones from `Managed/`; the host stops with an error when
   one is missing.
5. Everything else loads from `Managed/` (game and third-party libraries). Our Steamworks.NET
   port and the engine bridge ship with the host and therefore take precedence.

The scripting assemblies of `ScriptingAssemblies.json` are preloaded before any game code runs,
as the player does.

**Native libraries.** `ResolvingUnmanagedDll` on the game ALC maps the game's `DllImport`
names (`SimDLL`, `fmodstudio`, `resonanceaudio`, `steam_api`, `cimgui`, …) to
`OxygenNotIncluded_Data/Plugins/lib*.so`. BRUTAL installs its own per-assembly resolvers;
we never call `SetDllImportResolver` on BRUTAL assemblies. Brutal.Vulkan asks for `vulkan`,
which on Linux only the loader's -dev package provides (`libvulkan.so`); the default ALC's
`ResolvingUnmanagedDll` maps that name, for Brutal.Vulkan only, to `libvulkan.so.1`
(`VkContext.LoaderPresent`).

**The Windows executable.** On Windows `OniMoono.exe` is our own native host
(`src/OniMoono.NativeHost/host.c`, about 150 lines of C), not the .NET SDK's apphost, which
can't export data. The drivers of hybrid-graphics laptops (NVIDIA Optimus, AMD PowerXpress) read
two DWORD exports of the process's main executable, `NvOptimusEnablement` and
`AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance`, and pick the discrete GPU when they are nonzero. The
original `OxygenNotIncluded.exe` exports both with the value 1, so ours does too. Otherwise it
does what the apphost did, the documented way (dotnet/runtime's
`docs/design/features/native-hosting.md`): `hostfxr.dll` from its own folder when it's there (the
self-contained player of setups and releases, as the apphost looks first), else the installed
.NET's through nethost's `get_hostfxr_path` (the framework-dependent `scripts/build-windows.sh`
player); then `hostfxr_initialize_for_dotnet_command_line` with `OniMoono.dll` and the process's
arguments as the C runtime split them, `hostfxr_run_app`, `hostfxr_close`, and the app's exit
code. A failure to start goes to stderr when that is redirected, else to a message box and a
line in the game's `Player.log`. It keeps the apphost's resources: the icon as resource 32512
(`GlfwPlatform.SetClassIcon` loads it), the SDK's manifest (`asInvoker` only; GLFW sets the DPI
awareness), the version information and the GUI subsystem. It is built with MSVC and the static C
runtime by `build.cmd`, driven from WSL by `scripts/build-native-host.sh` (`build-windows.sh` and
`release.sh` call it); `setup.ps1` builds it when the Visual Studio C++ build tools are installed
and otherwise keeps the SDK's apphost, with a warning (that player starts the same but gives no
GPU hint). `scripts/check-windows-host.py EXE [--like OTHER]` checks a built exe from its PE file
alone: both exports present, writable and 1, the icon, manifest, version and subsystem.

**The GPU option** (`GpuChoice`; Moono Tweaks' "Graphics card", settings.json `"gpu"`, `--gpu
default|discrete|integrated`) is applied in `Program.Main` before the window opens, so before
anything loads the OpenGL driver. On Windows it writes the two exports through
`GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(NULL), …)`: 1 for discrete, 0 for integrated; `default` leaves
them at 1, as the original has them. The drivers read them when the GL driver loads (not
verifiable without a hybrid laptop), and Windows' Graphics settings page overrides them. Unity's
Linux player sets no GPU hints, and `-force-device-index` covers Direct3D, Metal and Vulkan only,
not ONI's OpenGL build, so on Linux `default` sets nothing. `discrete` asks for PRIME render
offload: `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1` and `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia` when NVIDIA's
proprietary driver is there (`/proc/driver/nvidia/version` and a loadable `libGLX_nvidia.so.0`),
else Mesa's `DRI_PRIME=1`; `integrated` sets `DRI_PRIME=0`. They go into the native environment
with libc's `setenv` (.NET's `Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable` changes only .NET's copy on
Unix, which libGL never reads) and into .NET's, for processes the player starts. A variable the
user set is left alone; those Moono set are listed in `ONI_MOONO_GPU_ENV`, so the run
`App.Restart` starts replaces them with its own choice. On a desktop whose display is on the
discrete card, `DRI_PRIME=1` may pick the integrated GPU. The log has a `gpu:` line with what was
set, then the `OpenGL:` line naming the renderer.

The Vulkan device (§3.5) picks its GPU itself among those Vulkan lists (`VkContext.Choose`),
never one that lacks a requirement, and a software one only with `--renderer vulkan`.
`integrated` takes an integrated GPU and `discrete` a discrete one, the first listed of that
type, else the other kind, then a virtual GPU. `default` matches the original on each system: on
Windows a discrete GPU, as the exports ask the drivers; on Linux, where the original sets
nothing and OpenGL draws on the driver's default GPU, the first GPU the driver lists. The log
names the devices Vulkan lists and the one taken (`vulkan: using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
(discrete, gpu option default)`, `…; gpu option integrated prefers an integrated GPU, and none is
usable`, or on Linux `…: the first GPU the driver lists`). The exports and Windows' Graphics
settings page do not change the Vulkan device's choice; they steer the OpenGL fallback as
before. On Linux the PRIME variables also reach Vulkan, where they only order the list: Mesa's
device-select layer puts the `DRI_PRIME` GPU first, and NVIDIA's `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1`
loads its `VK_LAYER_NV_optimus` layer, which puts NVIDIA's GPUs first (NVIDIA's README, "PRIME
Render Offload"). That decides `default` on a hybrid laptop, as it decides OpenGL's GPU; the
other choices pick by type whatever the order. NVIDIA's finer `__VK_LAYER_NV_optimus` setting
is not set: it applies only with the layer loaded, and its values hide the other vendor's GPUs
on older drivers and sort them on newer ones, neither of which the choice by type needs.
Verified on the Windows desktop: `--gpu integrated` renders on the AMD Radeon iGPU, `default`
and `discrete` on the RTX 3090.

### 2.1 Replacing Mono: runtime compatibility (*runtime §0*)

Binding and JIT are clean: every BCL reference in the game resolves on .NET 10 and all ~82k
game methods JIT. The differences that remain are behaviours Mono's class libraries provided
and .NET 10 ships out-of-band. The host restores them the way .NET documents for
.NET Framework-era code where it can. Game methods are patched at run time only where they
persist or depend on runtime-specific values: two serialization paths (D1 state-machine
parameter names, D3 a local mod's version stamp), mods' loading (D11) and the bubble manager's
one use of a struct's hash as an identity (D26). The game's conversions of floats to integers
are rewritten as its assemblies load (D29), in the same pass as its directory listings (D30),
the double close in 0Harmony's MonoMod (D31) and its thread aborts (D47). The game's Harmony is
adjusted where patches would run differently on CoreCLR (D12–D14, D17–D21, D33, D34, D43), and
mods' assemblies are rewritten as they load where their IL relies on Mono (D11, D22, D23,
D27–D32, D40, D42, D47, D50, D51). No other game IL
is touched.

| Mono provided | Host provides | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| CAS types in mscorlib | `System.Security.Permissions` package in the host's deps | Newtonsoft.Json 7 (save header, settings, mods.json, key bindings) |
| In-box BinaryFormatter | `System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters` package + `EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization` | `ObjectCloner.SerializingCloner` (every worldgen settings clone) |
| Code pages via `I18N*` | `Encoding.RegisterProvider(CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance)` before game code | Ionic.Zip static constructors (IBM437) |
| `System.CodeDom` | `System.CodeDom` package (binding only; never executed) | Ionic.Zip SFX path (dead) |
| Settings classes (`System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase`, in Mono's `System.dll`) | `System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager` package | mods' generated `Properties.Settings` classes (a mod whose types fail to load is dropped by KMod) |
| Reflection writes to `static readonly` fields (and reads that observe them) | Static fields of assemblies from `Managed/` and of mods' assemblies (`ModAccess`; the game's `LocString.CreateLocStringKeys` writes back mods' strings classes) are loaded with `InitOnly` cleared (Field-table flags only; IL untouched; such images load from memory, so their `Assembly.Location` is empty, which no game code reads) | `Localization.OverloadStrings` (translations of `STRINGS.UI.PERMIT_RARITY`), `LocString.CreateLocStringKeys` |
| Assemblies preloaded by the player | Host eagerly loads every assembly in `ScriptingAssemblies.json` that we serve, before any game type initializes | `App..cctor` / `KSerialization.Manager` assembly snapshots |

**Steamworks.NET.** One explicit-layout union in `com.rlabrecque.steamworks.net` 20.1.0
(`SteamDatagramRelayAuthTicket+ExtraField+OptionValue`, `byte[]` overlapping `long`) is
accepted by Mono and rejected by CoreCLR's type loader; the game's whole-domain
`GetTypes()` scans then crash. This is a third-party library that does not support our runtime,
so we port it: build Steamworks.NET **20.1.0 from upstream source** (MIT) under the same
assembly name and version, with that one union changed to a CoreCLR-valid layout. The port
lives in `src/ThirdParty/Steamworks.NET/` with the upstream commit pinned and the diff
documented. The host serves it instead of the shipped copy.

**Steam itself** is required, as for the original game: `SteamAPI.Init()` failure makes
`SteamManager` call `Application.Quit(2)`, and our `Application.Quit` honours it. Running
past the boot checkpoint needs a Steam client logged in with an account that owns the game.

**Documented deviations**: where Mono and CoreCLR, or Unity's player and ours, differ in ways
game or mod code can notice. Each says how it is resolved, or why it is kept.

- **D1 State-machine parameters in saves.** `StateMachineSerializer` stores and matches
  parameters by their context type's `Type.FullName`, whose generic arguments are
  assembly-qualified (`mscorlib` on Mono, `System.Private.CoreLib` here; Unity modules versus the
  engine assembly). Unpatched, no parameter of a save from the original matched and all loaded
  at their defaults: a large colony (DeCrew, cycle 17628) lost all fifteen Duplicants within
  four cycles, its food and suit docks unreachable, where the original keeps it alive.
  **Resolved by a patch:** the host (`StateMachineSaveNames`) has the serializer use the names
  the original player writes (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoTypeNames`, each type argument's assembly
  taken from the game's own Mono class libraries in `Managed/` or the engine facades), so saves
  load fully in both players in both directions. Saves written by this player before the patch
  carry CoreCLR names; their state-machine parameters load at defaults once. Everything else in
  saves (KSerialization body, Sim blob, header) is runtime-independent.
- **D2 Number formatting.** `double`/`float.ToString()` without a format prints the shortest
  round-trippable string on .NET (Mono printed 15 significant digits), and a negative value
  that rounds to zero keeps its sign ("-0.0" where Mono printed "0.0") — cosmetic, in game
  code's own formatting. Fixed-decimal formats round differently at a half: Mono rounds a
  float's 7-significant-digit form, .NET its exact value, so `67.255f.ToString("F2")` is "67.26"
  on Mono and "67.25" here (`0.005f`: "0.01" and "0.00"). Kept: .NET's is the exact rounding of
  the value the game holds. The engine's own `ToString` methods (vectors, colours, matrices, rects)
  format as Unity's Mono player does.
- **D3 `string.GetHashCode`** is randomized per process (Mono's is stable). Its only persisted
  use is the version stamp of local and dev (unpackaged) mods in `mods.json`
  (`KMod.Local.Subscribe`: `directoryName.GetHashCode()`). Left alone, the stamp differs at
  every launch, so `KMod.Manager` treats the mod as changed, asks for a restart and disables
  it. **Resolved by a patch:** the host (`ModVersionStamp`) uses the game's Harmony to replace
  that one call with Mono's algorithm (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoStringHash`, the .NET Framework
  64-bit hash, checked against the original player with tools/UnityProbe). Stamps are then
  stable and equal to the original player's, so `mods.json` works in both players. Game code's
  other `GetHashCode` calls stay randomized, and none of them is persisted. A `mods.json`
  written before the patch carries random stamps: each local mod asks for a restart once and has
  to be re-enabled once.
- **D4 `Thread.Abort`** throws on CoreCLR. It is reached during play too, not only at shutdown
  as first thought: D47 has how the host aborts as Mono does.
- **D5 `Process.MainModule`** is the host executable; `App.Restart` relaunches the host (we make
  the host the executable that is relaunched, so this works as intended).
- **D6 Runtime tight sprite meshes.** `Sprite.Create(…, SpriteMeshType.Tight)` traces alpha
  outlines in Unity with an unpublished algorithm; the engine creates the full-rect mesh
  instead. Rendered pixels are identical (the omitted area is fully transparent); only
  `sprite.vertices`/`triangles` differ. Sprites loaded from data keep their baked meshes.
- **D7 `GarbageCollector.GCMode`.** CoreCLR's collector cannot be switched off; Disabled and
  Manual hold a no-GC region (`GC.TryStartNoGCRegion`, budget a quarter of available memory),
  re-entered each frame if the runtime had to end it. Entering may collect once, and an
  exhausted budget collects where Unity's heap would grow. Only the game's scripted-profiling
  path changes the mode.
- **D8 TextMesh scale.** Legacy `TextMesh` geometry comes from the same legacy text generator
  as uGUI `Text`, at 0.1 world units per font pixel times `characterSize`. Unity's exact native
  scale and line-box metrics for TextMesh are unpublished; only TMP's example scripts create
  TextMeshes, so no game screen depends on them.
- **D9 UnloadUnusedAssets and ScriptableObject callbacks.** Unloading probes reachability with
  the runtime's collector (the object table holds candidates weakly for one collection), so a
  reclaimed object cannot run code. ScriptableObjects whose type declares `OnDisable` or
  `OnDestroy` (Unity calls both when it unloads one) are therefore never unloaded. No
  ScriptableObject in the game declares either.
- **D10 JsonUtility digits.** Unity's JSON writer is RapidJSON 1.1.0, whose Grisu2 rounding of
  the last digits of long outputs indexes past a ten-entry table and multiplies by whatever
  bytes follow it in `UnityPlayer.so` (identified by matching 35 observed outputs). The engine
  implements the corrected algorithm, so for such values its last digit can be smaller than
  Unity's (0.2f: …224 here, …225 in Unity); both parse back to the same number. The game writes
  JSON with `JsonUtility` only for its scripted performance capture.
- **D11 Mods built against publicized game assemblies.** Many mods are compiled against copies
  of the game's assemblies with every member made public, and use private members directly. Mono
  does not check member access at run time; CoreCLR throws FieldAccessException or
  MethodAccessException when such a method is compiled. **Resolved by a patch** (`ModAccess`):
  the host replaces the `Assembly.LoadFrom` call in `KMod.DLLLoader.LoadDLLs`, and a mod
  assembly that names a game member or type its code could not reach (private, internal) is
  given CoreCLR's `IgnoresAccessChecksTo` attribute for `Assembly-CSharp`,
  `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass`, the game's `0Harmony` (Mono.Cecil; the Multiplayer Mod reads
  Harmony's private fields) and `Unity.TextMeshPro` (Text Input Hotkeys calls
  `TMP_InputField.Backspace()`) and loaded from memory, its symbols with it. The
  game's own assemblies are not changed (making their members public instead would change what
  KSerialization saves: its default opt-out mode saves every public field and property). The mod
  still sees itself as loaded from its file: `Assembly.Location` reports the file (mods find
  their folders from it) and its folder is searched for its references. Other mods load as
  before. A protected member counts as reachable only when one of the mod's classes derives
  from its class, as CoreCLR's check has it: Public Cots and Public Luxury Beds read the
  protected `StateMachine.GenericInstance.smi` from a postfix of `SleepChoreMonitor`'s
  `UpdateBed`, which CoreCLR refused (MethodAccessException, the crash screen as the save
  loaded) while the original runs it. `--check-types` loads a mod calling the protected
  `KMonoBehaviour.OnSpawn` from a class of its own (loaded with access checks off, and run) and
  one calling it from a subclass (loaded as it is).
- **D12 `callvirt` to a static method.** Mono compiles one as a call; CoreCLR's JIT rejects the
  method ("Method not found: '?'"). C# compilers never emit it, but Harmony transpilers that
  swap an instance call for a static helper and keep the opcode do (Mod Updater's patch of
  `KMod.Manager.Subscribe`). **Resolved by a patch** of the game's Harmony (`TranspiledCalls`):
  the instructions its transpilers produce (`CodeTranspiler.GetResult`) have such calls made
  calls, as Mono would run them, and each is logged.
- **D13 Inlined patches of value types' virtual methods.** Before detouring a method,
  Harmony's MonoMod marks its MethodDesc not to be inlined, so code compiled later calls the
  patched method. For a value type's override (`GetHashCode`, `Equals`, `ToString`), the handle
  reflection gives is the method's unboxing stub; the JIT inlines the unboxed MethodDesc after
  it, which stays unmarked, so code tiered up after the patch ran the original (Fast Track's
  `AxialI.GetHashCode`: dictionary lookups missed, `ClusterGrid.RegisterEntity` threw on every
  starmap entity). Mono has no unboxing stubs. **Resolved by a patch** of MonoMod's
  `PlatformTriple.TryDisableInlining` (`UnboxedMethods`): the unboxed MethodDesc is marked too
  (CoreCLR 10's layout; the host's `--check-types` patches an emitted value type's
  `GetHashCode` and fails if dictionary lookups miss after tier-up).
- **D14 Mono's enum formatting.** Mods that add elements name their `SimHashes` values by
  patching enum formatting: Mono's private `Enum.InternalFormat(RuntimeType eT, Object value)`, or
  `Enum.ToString()`. In Mono's `system/enum.cs`, `ToString()` is
  `InternalFormat(GetType(), GetValue())` (the enum's type and underlying value);
  `ToString(format)` with "G" or none, the obsolete overloads and the IFormattable route
  `string.Format` takes all call the virtual `ToString()`; `Format(type, value, "G")` calls
  `InternalFormat`. CoreCLR has no InternalFormat, and its `ToString(format)` and span formatting
  do not go through `ToString()` (Rocketry Expanded's ElementUtil: the patch failed, element names
  came out as numbers, lookups by name failed). **Resolved by patches** of `AccessTools.Method`
  and `AccessTools.DeclaredMethod` (the latter is how `[HarmonyPatch]` attributes resolve) and of
  Harmony's `PatchProcessor.Patch` (`MonoEnumFormat`): looked up on `Enum`, the name gives a
  stand-in with Mono's signature, and once a mod patches it or `Enum.ToString()` the formatting is
  routed as Mono routes it; without such a mod nothing is patched. `--check-types` patches both
  as mods do and checks each path.
- **D15 A second version of a loaded assembly.** For an assembly without a strong name, Mono
  answers a load of another file with the assembly already loaded under that simple name,
  whatever the versions (`mono_domain_assembly_search` compares names ignoring version, key and
  case). CoreCLR refuses the second version, and KMod then drops the whole mod (a mod shipping its
  own copy of a library another mod loaded first). Mono's binding of a reference to such an
  assembly searches the same way, so a mod built against PLib 4.22 runs with an older PLib another
  mod loaded; CoreCLR fails the reference ("manifest definition does not match"). **Resolved in**
  `ModAccess`: such a file is given the loaded assembly (`LoadFrom`), and a reference CoreCLR cannot
  bind is given the assembly loaded under its simple name (the default context's Resolving event);
  each substitution is logged. `--check-types` loads two versions of an emitted assembly and binds a
  third that references the second. Strong-named assemblies and the rest of the binding order:
  D45.
- **D16 Exceptions nothing catches on other threads.** They end a CoreCLR process; Unity's
  player keeps running (measured with PerfProbe in the original: a thread's exception is logged,
  by UnityEngine's AppDomain.UnhandledException handler calling Debug.LogException; a thread-pool
  item's and an async void method's are dropped silently, with no UnhandledException; Mono passes
  IsTerminating true). Sgt_Imalas' UtilLibs checks for updates from an async void method that
  throws when offline. **Resolved by** .NET 10's `ExceptionHandling.SetUnhandledExceptionHandler`
  (`UnhandledExceptions`): a thread's exception raises UnhandledException (and is logged as
  Unity's are), a thread pool's is dropped, the main thread's still ends the process;
  `--check-types` throws on both kinds of thread.
- **D17 A try block entered with values on the stack.** ECMA-335 requires an empty evaluation
  stack where a try block starts; CoreCLR's JIT refuses a method that enters one with values on
  it (InvalidProgramException when Harmony applies the patch), and Mono compiles it. Harmony
  transpilers that insert a call returning a value nobody uses produce such methods (Better Info
  Cards' patch of `SelectToolHoverTextCard.UpdateHoverElements` leaves a `KSelectable` behind
  before a `foreach`; the mod failed to load). **Resolved by a patch** of the game's Harmony
  (`TranspiledTryEntries`, beside D12's): in the instructions its transpilers produce, values a
  try block is entered with and never consumes are popped before it. They are dead, since `leave`
  and `throw`, the only ways out of a try, empty the stack. A method whose try block does use them,
  or that the analysis cannot follow, is left as it was, and each change is logged.
  `--check-types` transpiles a method so and runs it.
- **D18 Patches of a generic class's shared code.** A method of a generic class instantiated
  over reference types only runs code that every such instantiation shares, on Mono as on
  CoreCLR (with a value type argument too, on CoreCLR only: D38), so
  a patch of one instantiation's method applies to all (Better Info Cards patches
  `HoverTextDrawer.Pool<MonoBehaviour>.Draw`, which the game never instantiates, to see the
  widgets its `Pool<Image>` and `Pool<LocText>` draw). When tiered compilation recompiles that
  shared code, MonoMod moves its detour to the new code only for a recompiled method equal to the
  patched one; the shared code's is the canonical method (`Pool<__Canon>.Draw`), so the patch
  stopped running once the method tiered up (Better Info Cards: NullReferenceException every
  frame after a few seconds of hovering). **Resolved** in `SharedGenerics`, which subscribes to
  MonoMod's method-compiled event and hands MonoMod's handler every patched method of a generic
  class that has the recompiled method's handle (instantiations sharing code share their method
  handle). Code that inlined such shared code before the patch is not rebuilt (D34).
  `--check-types` patches an emitted generic class's method for one argument and calls it for
  another past tier-up.
- **D19 Patch methods' frames.** Harmony calls a mod's prefixes, postfixes and finalizers from
  the replacement it builds for the patched method, a dynamic method owned by 0Harmony. CoreCLR's
  JIT inlines a small patch method into it, so what the patch method calls sees 0Harmony as its
  caller (`Assembly.GetCallingAssembly()`): Traffic Visualizer's SquareLib looks for its icons in
  0Harmony's folder, and the game stopped loading. On Mono the patch method keeps its frame (the
  mod works in the original player). **Resolved in** `PatchFrames`: before Harmony builds a
  replacement, each patch method of a mod is marked not to be inlined (MonoMod's
  `TryDisableInlining`, which Harmony applies to the patched method itself); this project's own
  patches are left as they were. `--check-types` calls `GetCallingAssembly` from a helper an
  emitted mod's postfix calls. The replacement's own frame goes too when its last call is a patch
  method: a postfix of a method returning nothing is called right before the replacement's `ret`,
  and the JIT (replacements are compiled fully optimized) makes that call a tail call. Mono makes
  no implicit tail calls. Cold Wheat Seed Drop's postfix of `SeedProducer.CropPicked` names the
  type `Worker`, gone from the game, and throws when a crop is picked in both players (D40); the
  original's trace starts with the replacement (`CropPicked_Patch1`, read as
  `SeedProducer.CropPicked`), ours with the game's lambda that called it, a log signature the
  original lacks. `PatchFrames` therefore follows each call of a mod's patch method that the
  replacement's `ret` follows (past `nop`s) with `ldc.i4.0; pop` (in `FaultBlockRewriter.Rewrite`,
  the last step before Harmony emits the replacement), which the JIT compiles to nothing and
  which takes the call out of tail position. Calls elsewhere keep their tail calls.
  Stack indices inside a patch depend on it: No Minimum Temperature's only postfix of the
  `ElementConverter.OutputElement` constructor reads `new StackTrace(2).GetFrame(0)` for the
  building config that made the element, and found `BuildingConfigManager.RegisterBuilding` there
  before the fix (no minimum temperature reverted; the original reverts 26, as ours does now).
  UnityProbe's `stackdepth` scenario, a second postfix of that constructor, lists the same frames
  in both players: the postfix, the replacement (`ElementConverter+OutputElement..ctor_PatchN`,
  declared by `DynamicMethodDefinition`, D23), the config's `ConfigureBuildingTemplate`, then
  `RegisterBuilding`.
  `--check-types` patches a method returning nothing with a mod's postfix that throws, and finds
  the replacement's frame under the postfix's; and patches an emitted struct's constructor with a
  postfix that reads `new StackTrace(2)`, called from a `ConfigureBuildingTemplate`.
- **D20 Patching a P/Invoke whose export is missing.** MonoMod prepares a method before
  detouring it; for a P/Invoke, CoreCLR then binds the native export, and a missing one fails the
  patch. Mono binds a P/Invoke at its first call, so mods patch one the platform lacks to keep it
  from being called: Debug Buttons and ONI Together skip `KImGuiUtil.SetKAssertCB`, which the
  game's Linux cimgui does not export, and load in the original player. **Resolved in**
  `PInvokePatches`: a missing export or library does not fail the preparation of a P/Invoke; the
  detour goes on the method's own entry, other P/Invokes bind as before, and calling the original
  still fails as on Mono. CoreCLR's JIT also inlines the transition of a P/Invoke that needs no
  marshalling into optimized callers (all game and mod code, even at tier 0; not a debug build's
  own code), which then call the native target directly, never the detour: the prefix was
  skipped, and a missing export threw. `PInvokePatches` marks a P/Invoke prepared for a patch as
  needing marshalling (CoreCLR 10's cached flag on its MethodDesc), so code compiled from then
  on, including a tier-up of a caller compiled before, calls its entry. A caller's code compiled
  before the patch still calls past it until it is recompiled. `--check-types` patches a P/Invoke
  to a missing export and one to an export libc has, and calls each from a dynamic method
  (compiled optimized in either build); `scripts/check.sh` runs it on the release build too.
- **D21 Patches of methods an earlier replacement calls or inlines.** Harmony compiles a patched
  method's replacement fully optimized, and CoreCLR's JIT inlines methods it calls, and, through
  them, the methods those call; a method patched later is marked not to be inlined from then on,
  but a replacement compiled before keeps its old body inlined and the later patch never runs
  there (True Tiles patches `BlockTileRenderer.GetConnectionBits`, then `MatchesDef`, which it
  calls: no tile connected to its neighbours; Forever Eruption Geyser patches
  `Geyser.GetEmitRate`, then `GetIterationPercent`, which it reaches through `GetOnDuration`: the
  emit rate kept the unpatched share). On Mono the later patch takes effect (both mods work in the
  original player). **Resolved in** `PatchDependents`: the host records the methods each
  replacement's instructions call (from `CodeTranspiler.GetResult`) and reads, once each, the IL of
  every candidate for inlining reachable from them through candidates: a call graph. A candidate
  has IL (not abstract, a P/Invoke or an internal call), is not marked NoInlining or synchronized,
  is not patched yet, and has at most 1024 bytes of IL or is marked AggressiveInlining; a virtual
  one counts, as the JIT inlines one it devirtualizes. 1024 is the JIT's bound
  (`JitExtDefaultPolicyMaxILProf`, its bound with profile data, not the 128 without, and
  measured: a replacement inlines 1024 bytes of straight-line IL two calls down, never 1026). The
  first time a candidate (or a P/Invoke, whose call is inlined too) is patched, the host walks the
  graph back from it through unpatched candidates, 20 calls deep (the JIT's inlining depth), and
  rebuilds the replacements already made that call any method on the way, as Harmony rebuilds one
  when a patch is added. The rule over-approximates (it ignores the JIT's budget and call-site
  heuristics), which costs only time at mod load; replacements run as compiled. Eight
  Harmony-heavy mods together (Fast Save, Ronivans Legacy, Research Manager, Popup Control,
  Duplicant Stat Selector, Sweep By Type, Better Automation Overlay, Favorite Resources) read
  43,600 bodies in 0.6–0.75 s and rebuild 230 times (126 replacements) in 1.2 s; Forever Eruption
  Geyser alone rebuilds 18 times. The graph misses an override the JIT reaches by devirtualizing
  a call to a base method (the call names the base method, whose body is followed instead);
  D34's record of the JIT's own decisions covers it.
  `--check-types` patches a caller, then a method it calls, and calls the caller; and patches A,
  then C, which A reaches through B, with C of 4, 1024 and 1026 bytes of IL, and calls A.
- **D22 Classes missing a method of an interface they list.** A mod built against an older game
  can have a class that no longer implements every method of a game interface (Wireless Power's
  side screen lacks the new `ISliderControl.GetSliderTooltip(int)`). Mono loads the class and fails
  only when it is checked or used through the interface (measured in the original player: "VTable
  setup of type … failed" from `IsAssignableFrom` with an interface; KMod's `GetTypes` and
  `UserMod2` check pass, and Wireless Power runs). CoreCLR refuses the class when it loads, so
  `GetTypes` throws and KMod drops the whole mod. **Resolved in** `MissingInterfaceMethods`:
  before `ModAccess` loads a mod's assembly, it is loaded once in a collectible context that binds
  only to assemblies already loaded, and that context is collected before the real load (until
  then `AppDomain.GetAssemblies` lists its copy, and PLib, which picks its instance from there,
  ran the copy, whose `Location` is empty: Threshold Walls). The methods CoreCLR reports missing
  get an explicit implementation that throws the `TypeLoadException` CoreCLR would have. The class
  loads, and calling the missing method fails. Where Mono fails earlier (an interface check of the class),
  ours goes on. `--check-types` loads a mod built against an older shape of an interface, whose
  new method takes one of the game's own types (Trashcans), and calls the method it lacks.
- **D23 Stack frames of patched methods.** Harmony runs a patched method as a dynamic method that
  MonoMod creates with an owner type. On Mono, a frame of it reports a method declared by that
  owner, `MonoMod.Utils.DynamicMethodDefinition` (measured in the original player); CoreCLR's
  `StackFrame.GetMethod` returns the `DynamicMethod`, whose `DeclaringType` and `ReflectedType`
  are null. Customize Plants walks the stack for the class whose `CreatePrefab` made a plant, and
  a null there ended the game's asset setup when another mod had patched a `CreatePrefab` (the
  save never loaded). **Resolved in** `MonoStackFrames`: a mod's calls to `StackFrame.GetMethod`
  (found in its metadata) call the host's instead, which reports a dynamic method with an owner
  as declared by the owner. In a trace's text, Mono names a replacement's frame `(wrapper
  dynamic-method) MonoMod.Utils.DynamicMethodDefinition.T.M_PatchN` and CoreCLR `T.M_PatchN`;
  the test tools' log signatures (`qa-tools.py`) read either as `T.M`, the method patched, since
  the host patches some of Harmony's own methods (D14, D38) that the original runs unpatched:
  Printerceptor Reimagined's refused patches showed `PatchProcessor.Patch_Patch2` in ours alone.
  Writing the rewritten mod resolves its references against the
  assemblies already loaded (an enum default value's type: PLib's mods), and a mod that cannot be
  rewritten loads unchanged. `--check-types` walks the stack from a patched method of a mod
  whose method takes a game enum with a default value.
- **D24 Special folders that do not exist.** On Linux and macOS, Mono's
  `Environment.GetFolderPath` gives a special folder's path (its XDG user directory, or the home's
  `Desktop`, `Documents`…) whether or not it exists; CoreCLR checks unless asked not to and gives
  "" otherwise. Harmony's debug log creates the Desktop folder from that path, so a mod that turns
  the log on (Simple Cheat) failed to load on a machine without `~/Desktop`:
  `Directory.CreateDirectory("")` throws. **Resolved in** `MonoFolderPaths`: the default option
  is answered without the existence check, as Mono answers it; Windows is unchanged.
  `--check-types` asks for the Desktop of a home that has none.
- **D25 Float intermediate precision.** Unity starts Mono with `-O=-float32`
  (`UnityPlayer.so`; Mono's own default is float32 on): float arithmetic is evaluated in double
  and rounded to float32 only where the value is stored (a local, field, array element,
  parameter or return value) or cast. CoreCLR rounds every float operation to float32. So a
  float expression used without being stored first can differ in the last bit:
  `(int)(0.7f * 10f)` is 6 on Mono and 7 here, `Math.Round(0.9f * 255)` 229 and 230. In the game
  this shows as rare off-by-one results where a product lands on an integer, such as the germs
  a ladder passes on (`(int)(count * 0.005f)`, one fewer on Mono at multiples of 200), and in
  some UI roundings at a half. Kept: .NET's results are those the code as written asks for, and
  emulating Mono (widening every float load and call result in all game and mod IL) would
  break mods' transpilers that match IL patterns. Measured by `tools/UnityProbe`
  (FloatPrecision.cs, `PROBE_SCENARIO=floatprec`); test tools that compare players compute in
  double, where both runtimes agree. The engine's own versions of Unity's managed math follow
  Mono where it was measured: `Matrix4x4`'s products (`MultiplyPoint3x4`, `MultiplyPoint`,
  `MultiplyVector`, matrix × vector and matrix × matrix) sum each element in double and round
  once, as in the original bit for bit (`PROBE_SCENARIO=matmul`, `mm-check.py`; ScrollRect's
  change detection depends on it, `docs/cleanroom/ugui.md` "ScrollRect: bounds to the bit").
  `Matrix4x4.inverse` is native float code in the original, Mesa's Gauss–Jordan inversion; the
  engine ports it (`MesaInverse`, MIT), bit for bit with the original. So are the
  projection builders (`PROBE_SCENARIO=projection`, `pj-check.py`): `Ortho` and `Frustum` are
  Mesa's (`MesaFrustum`, MIT), `LookAt` is `gluLookAt`'s basis arithmetic in Unity's layout
  (`GluLookAt`, SGI Free Software License B), and `Perspective` and `Quaternion.AngleAxis`
  are float code with the C library's sinf and cosf, which MathF calls too; the engine follows
  all five bit for bit. Neither Mesa's nor GLU's, but measured and followed bit for bit too:
  `Inverse3DAffine` (native float cofactors over a SIMD-shaped determinant), `Rotate` (managed:
  its diagonal is evaluated in double under the Mono, as above, where `TRS` is native float), and
  the camera's rects, `worldToCameraMatrix` and screen conversions (float P·V, a whole-pixel
  viewport, an unprojection at depth 0.95), all but the perspective rays' direction
  (`docs/cleanroom/ugui.md`, "Camera and projection math").
  The transform hierarchy's world matrix, rotation and lossy scale are native float code in the
  original, composed from the leaf up; the engine follows it bit for bit (`HierarchyMath`,
  `docs/cleanroom/ugui.md` "Transform hierarchy to the bit").
- **D26 Hashes of structs without a GetHashCode.** A struct that does not override GetHashCode
  is hashed by `ValueType.GetHashCode`. Mono XORs every field into the hash
  (`ves_icall_System_ValueType_InternalGetHashCode`: an `int` field's value, a string field's
  `mono_string_hash_internal`, any other field's own `GetHashCode`), starting from the address
  of a runtime structure. CoreCLR uses the first field alone when the struct holds floats or
  references, so values that differ only in a later field collide. That is only slower in a
  dictionary, but `BubbleManager.Archetype.GetId` uses the hash as an identity: bubbles are
  filed under the hash of (velocity, element, fade speed), so every bubble rising straight up
  had one id, and the first element registered under it was the one every later bubble released
  (after an Oxy Coral's oxygen bubble, a Thermal Gas Fissure gave oxygen instead of natural
  gas). **Resolved by a patch** (`MonoValueTypeHashes`): that call computes Mono's hash
  (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoValueTypeHash`, starting from 0, so ids equal Mono's up to its
  per-process start).
  **Scanned** (2026-10-23, Mono.Cecil over IL: `constrained.` or `box` before
  `object::GetHashCode`, `EqualityComparer<T>.GetHashCode` and `HashCode` over such a struct;
  a struct as a dictionary key only hashes to a bucket and is left out): every game assembly
  in `Managed/` that is not Unity's or the BCL (Assembly-CSharp, Assembly-CSharp-firstpass,
  ImGui, ImGui.NET, FMODUnity*, Harmony, Newtonsoft.Json, VYaml, Ionic.Zip, LibNoiseDotNet,
  ArabicSupport, Steamworks.NET), and of mods only the Workshop builds in the catalog's
  `out/ws` (archived versions included), 1229 assemblies in all. Mods outside that set are
  not covered. Hits besides `GetId`, neither a collision under CoreCLR: Klei's ImGui object
  drawer (`MemberDrawerCollection.DrawFor`) puts the hash of `MemberDrawContext` (two bools)
  into an ImGui ID, an identity, but CoreCLR hashes a struct of plain values by all its bytes,
  so it tells the four values apart (Mono's XOR does not: (true, false) and (false, true)
  collide there); Antigravity Multiplayer (3635632392) sends the hash of `Random.state` (four
  ints, hashed by all bytes as well) to clients as a random seed, a value, not an identity.
  `--check-types` compares two elements' archetype ids. `tests/e2e/thermal-gas-fissure.yaml`
  checks the fissure's gas.
- **D27 Order of string-keyed concurrent dictionaries.** A `ConcurrentDictionary` enumerates its
  buckets in order, a bucket's newest entry first, in Mono's class library (`Managed/mscorlib.dll`)
  as in .NET's, so the order follows the keys' hashes and the table's size, and both differ for
  string keys: Mono's table has as many buckets as the capacity asked for (at least the
  concurrency level) and hashes with Mono's string hash; .NET rounds the capacity up to a prime
  (32 gives 37) and hashes with its own. PLib's component registry (`PRegistryComponent`, a
  `ConcurrentDictionary<string, …>(2, 32)`) initializes each component while it enumerates the
  registry, and PLib 4.16's `PBuildingManager` registers `PPatchManager` from its `Initialize`:
  Mono's order reaches that key afterwards, ours had passed it, so PLib's stages from
  `Db.Initialize` on never ran (Thermo Sensor Tile's techs were never registered; the original
  logs "Register techs"). **Resolved in** `MonoConcurrentDictionaries`: a mod's
  `new ConcurrentDictionary<string, T>(concurrencyLevel, capacity)` (found in its metadata) calls
  the host's instead, which gives the dictionary a comparer whose hash is the key's bucket in
  Mono's table of that size modulo .NET's table size (the rest of Mono's hash above it), so it
  enumerates in Mono's order until Mono's table would grow (a lock holding more than capacity /
  concurrency level keys). The constructors without a size are left alone: Mono gives them one
  lock per processor and grows their table as soon as a lock holds more than 31 / processors keys,
  so their order in the original depends on the machine. `--check-types` enumerates such a
  dictionary of a mod against Mono's order and adds a key during the enumeration as PLib does.
- **D28 Stack overflows.** Mono turns a stack overflow into a `StackOverflowException` that the
  code below it can catch. Measured in the original player: a test mod whose patch of
  `Telepad.OnSpawn` recursed without end had the game log "Error in
  HeadquartersComplete.Telepad.OnSpawn … System.StackOverflowException: The requested operation
  caused a stack overflow." (`KMonoBehaviour.Spawn` catches every exception), show its error
  dialog and play on. CoreCLR ends the process instead (exit code 134 on Linux, 0xC00000FD on
  Windows) and writes "Stack overflow." and the frames to stderr only, so the player's log just
  stops where the recursion began, as in issue #13's log. **Resolved in** `MonoStackOverflow`: a
  mod's methods on a call cycle among its own methods (from its IL: calls, generic
  instantiations, methods of its generic types, a virtual call reaching every virtual method of
  that name) start with a probe that throws `StackOverflowException`, with Mono's message, once
  `RuntimeHelpers.TryEnsureSufficientExecutionStack` fails; the probe is hidden from stack
  traces. That check wants 128 KB of stack left, so it always fails on a thread whose stack is
  128 KB, as the game's JobManager workers (and fast-jobs') are: issue #15's Stats Unlimited
  threw from its options getter on every worker where Mono ran it. On a stack of 256 KB or less
  (its bounds from `pthread_getattr_np` or `GetCurrentThreadStackLimits`) the probe throws only
  once less than half of it is left; 64 KB is enough to throw, and the handler runs at the
  catching frame. A recursion through game methods or another assembly is not covered, nor one in the
  game's own code. A mod that cannot be rewritten loads unchanged. `--check-types` runs a mod's
  self and mutual recursions without end, and a short recursion and one without end on a 128 KB
  thread.
- **D29 Float-to-integer conversions out of range.** Mono converts a float to an integer with
  the processor's truncating instruction (cvttsd2si), which gives the target's minimum for NaN,
  the infinities and values whose truncation is out of range; CoreCLR saturates since .NET 9
  (NaN gives 0, +∞ the maximum). Attribute Info Screen shows the bionic Duplicant's experience as
  `Mathf.RoundToInt(GetExperienceForNextLevel())`, which is NaN: "Xp:0/-2147483648" in the
  original, "Xp:0/0" here; `Grid.PosToCell` of a NaN position gave cell 0. Measured in the
  original player (`tools/UnityProbe`, `PROBE_SCENARIO=convert`, `cv-check.py rule`: 1596 of
  1596 lines follow these rules), every unchecked IL conversion of a float32 or float64, the
  float32 widened exactly: conv.i4 is the 32-bit conversion, conv.i1/i2/u1/u2 its low bits (300
  as a byte is 44, NaN 0); conv.i8 is the 64-bit conversion, conv.u4 its low 32 bits (-1 gives
  4294967295); conv.u8 and conv.u convert below 2^63 and otherwise convert the value less 2^63
  and flip the top bit (NaN, +∞ give 0, -∞ gives 2^63); conv.i is the 32-bit conversion
  zero-extended (Mono's amd64 back end; -1 gives 4294967295). Unity's `Mathf.RoundToInt`,
  `FloorToInt`, `CeilToInt` and `Vector2Int`/`Vector3Int`'s follow conv.i4. The checked
  conversions (conv.ovf.*), `Convert.ToXxx` and `Color32` from a `Color` agree in both players.
  **Resolved in** the engine's `Mathf` (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoConvert`: the processor's
  truncating instructions through `Sse2`, an equivalent comparison elsewhere) and in
  `MonoConversions`: as a game assembly from `Managed/` or a mod's assembly loads, each
  unchecked conversion whose operand is a float (found by following the IL's stack types along
  every path, generic instantiations included) calls a helper that converts as Mono does; a
  conversion reached with a float on one path and an integer on another, or a method whose IL
  is not followed, stays as it is. The game has 672 such conversions (Assembly-CSharp 501 in 272
  methods, firstpass 95, LibNoiseDotNet 69, Ionic.Zip 4, FMODUnity 1, 0Harmony 2 and 13 not
  followed), the catalog's 1137 mod assemblies 3502; checked against a local rule (a conversion
  right after a float load) with no disagreement. Costs measured: a conversion in a tight loop
  takes 0.75 ns instead of 0.52 (the float32 is widened first); four U57 runs of `qa.sh perf`
  alternating without and with the rewrite gave 32.9 and 43.8 fps without, 37.5 and 39.7 with
  (another session loaded the machine between runs; the spread between runs of one build is
  wider than any difference); rewriting the game's assemblies at load takes 2.4 s, so the
  images are kept in the player's cache folder (`oni-moono/conversions`, by the image's hash
  and the host build) and later starts read them. A Harmony transpiler sees the call where the
  IL had the conversion: no mod assembly in the catalog names an unchecked `OpCodes.Conv_*`
  field (`Conv_I4` and the rest), and none of our transpilers does. Not covered: our own UI packages and the
  engine's other code (compiled for .NET; `Mathf` aside), and an arm64 original (not measured;
  ours converts as the x86-64 one there too). `--check-types` loads a mod with conversions of
  floats, products, a generic result and a join of a float32 and a float64, and an integer's
  conversion, and compares them with the measured values.
- **D30 Order of directory listings.** On Linux and macOS, Unity's Mono hands out a folder's
  entries sorted by the bytes of their UTF-8 names (strcmp: Unicode code point order, so "B"
  before "_" before "a", "ﬀ" U+FB00 before "😀" U+1F600); CoreCLR hands them out in readdir order.
  Both class libraries enumerate with corefx's `FileSystemEnumerator` (Mono's
  `mcs/class/corlib/unix_build_corlib.dll.sources`), but Unity's `libmono-native` is built from
  its own `external/corefx-bugfix/src/Native/Unix/System.Native/pal_io.c`, whose
  `SystemNative_ReadDirR` reads the whole folder on the first call and `qsort`s it with strcmp
  (`CompareByName`); upstream corefx and .NET's `pal_io.c` do not sort, and the Linux and macOS
  `libmono-native` of the game import `qsort` and `strcmp`. A recursive listing walks breadth
  first in both (a queue of subfolders, each queued as its entry is read), so Mono's visits the
  subfolders in sorted order too. Measured in the original player (`tools/UnityProbe`,
  `PROBE_SCENARIO=dirorder`): every `Directory` and `DirectoryInfo` `Get*`/`Enumerate*` call,
  with and without patterns, recursive and with `EnumerationOptions`, sorted a folder created in
  another readdir order; an enumeration reads its folder on its first step (a file added after
  the call and before that step is listed, one added after it is not). On Windows both use
  `FindFirstFileEx` and the same corefx enumerator, so nothing differs there. True Tiles finds
  texture packs with `Directory.GetDirectories` and keeps packs of one Order in the order found:
  its settings list and the texture that won differed (True Tiles Material Pack's Aquatic,
  Prehistoric, Misc Tiles in the original; Misc Tiles first here). **Resolved in**
  `MonoDirectoryListing`, in `MonoConversions`' pass (D29) over the game's assemblies from
  `Managed/` (cached with it) and each mod's: every call of those methods (call, callvirt, and
  ldftn of `Directory`'s; a `DirectoryInfo` method's instance becomes the first parameter) calls
  the host's instead, which lists with .NET's own method (the same entries, paths and exceptions,
  thrown as eagerly) and reorders (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoDirectoryOrder`): a folder's results
  are read in full and sorted when first enumerated; a recursive one lists each folder alone (its
  `FileSystemEnumerable` reports the subfolders it would enter and does not), sorts its results,
  and queues its subfolders sorted, skipping one gone before its turn as .NET's walk does. A
  listing with CoreLib's own `MaxRecursionDepth` stays .NET's. Not covered: reflection calls,
  `FileSystemEnumerable` used directly, our own code, and a transpiler that looks for a listing
  call in game IL (no catalog mod names a listing method in a string). The game has 32 such
  calls (Assembly-CSharp 26, firstpass 2, Ionic.Zip 4). Cost: the sort, and on a recursive
  listing one list per folder: a folder of 200 files lists in 109 µs instead of 81 (GetFiles;
  EnumerateFiles 127 instead of 83), a tree of 21 folders and 600 files in 383 instead of 312.
  `--check-types` lists a mod's folders made in another
  order, recursively and through a delegate.
- **D31 MonoMod's helper file closed twice.** On Linux and macOS, Harmony's MonoMod writes its
  native exception helper to a temporary file on its first patch
  (`PosixNativeLibraryDrop.DropLibrary`: mkstemp, then, on CoreCLR,
  `new FileStream(fd, FileAccess.Write)`, which owns the descriptor and closes it when disposed,
  and then its own `close(fd)` once more). The second close fails harmlessly unless another
  thread opened a file in between and was given the same descriptor number: that file loses its
  descriptor. The host makes its first patches on another thread while the main thread opens the
  window, and a QA run's main thread failed to load Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool
  (FileNotFoundException in GLFW's type initializer, through BRUTAL's logging). Three threads
  opening and reading a file in a loop while the patches go in lost a descriptor (EBADF) in 15 of
  56 starts, each within 6 ms of the helper's last write; none did with the fix, in 40. Mono's
  own path closes the descriptor once, before reopening the file by name. **Resolved in** `MonoModHelperDrop`, in `MonoConversions`' pass (D29) over the game's
  0Harmony (cached with it) and any mod's copy of MonoMod: the FileStream is made with
  `ownsHandle: false`, so MonoMod's own close is the only one. `--check-types` drops the helper
  into a folder of its own and checks that no close failed.
- **D32 Nested types of the game a mod names that the game no longer has.** Mono resolves a
  TypeRef whose scope is another TypeRef in `mono_class_from_typeref_checked`
  (`mono/metadata/class.c`, `MONO_RESOLUTION_SCOPE_TYPEREF`; Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`). When the enclosing class's nested types are loaded already
  (`nested_classes_inited`), it scans that list by name; finding none, its loop variable is left
  on the list's last class, and after the warning "TypeRef ResolutionScope not yet handled" it
  returns that class with no error. When they are not loaded yet, it scans the metadata, returns
  nothing, and the reference fails with a TypeLoadException, as on CoreCLR. The list is the
  NestedClass table's order (`mono_class_setup_nested_types`), and it is loaded only by
  enumerating the class's nested types (`Type.GetNestedTypes`/`GetNestedType`, a nested name
  parsed by `Type.GetType`, Mono's own lookup of an `A/B` name), so in general the result
  depends on what ran before the mod's code. The game's strings are the exception:
  `Global.Awake` calls `Localization.RegisterForTranslation(typeof(UI))` before it loads the
  mods, and its `LocString.CreateLocStringKeys` enumerates the nested types (public and not) of
  every class of the STRINGS namespace in Assembly-CSharp, recursively, in every language.
  U&F-Translate Fix names `STRINGS.ROOMS.CRITERIA.DECOR20`, gone from the game: the original logs
  the warning and binds it to CRITERIA's last nested class, POWERBUILDING (its 20-decor
  constraint reads "电力建筑"), and plays; CoreCLR threw, the mod's type initializer failed and
  the game quit while loading. Mosaic Tile, Marble Tile and Insulated Joint Plate name
  `TUNING.DUPLICANTSTATS.MOVEMENT`, whose class nothing has enumerated by then: they fail in the
  original too. **Resolved in**
  `MonoNestedTypeRefs`, before `MissingInterfaceMethods` as `ModAccess` loads a mod: each nested
  TypeRef of the mod into a class of that STRINGS tree (by the game file's metadata) whose name
  the class lacks is renamed to the class's last nested type in the NestedClass table, and
  references within it are looked up there, as Mono looks them up; a class with no nested types
  fails as on Mono. Every other missing nested type is left to fail, which is Mono's result
  unless something had enumerated its class first (not known when the mod loads; in the catalog's
  `out/ws`, `Artable+Stage`, `ElementLoader+ElementEntry`, `Navigator+PathProbeTask` and
  `DUPLICANTSTATS+MOVEMENT`, among others, are such references). Of the catalog's mods, 19
  current builds name a missing nested type of `STRINGS.ROOMS.CRITERIA` (most of them
  `REFRIGERATOR`, some `DECOR20` and `MESSTABLE`); all bind to POWERBUILDING, as on Mono. A mod that cannot be rewritten loads unchanged. `--check-types` loads a mod naming
  `CRITERIA.DECOR20` (bound to the last nested class, its `NAME` read), a type within it, a
  nested type CRITERIA has, and `DUPLICANTSTATS.MOVEMENT`.
- **D33 Patches of two copies of a library naming a generic type over their own types.** Harmony's
  MonoMod builds a patched method's replacement from the original's IL read with Cecil and turns
  each member it names back into reflection's (`ReflectionHelper._ResolveReflection`), through a
  cache keyed by the member's name and the assembly of its declaring type. For a member of a
  generic type, `IEnumerable<IOptionsEntry>.GetEnumerator`, that assembly is the generic
  type's (mscorlib): the type arguments' are left out, on both runtimes. Mods that merge their
  own copy of PLib have same-named types in different assemblies, and a replacement made from
  one copy was given members of another copy's instantiations, resolved before it. The cache
  holds what it resolves weakly: Mono's reflection objects stay alive in the domain's table, so
  there the second copy always gets the first's; CoreCLR's can be collected in between, so here
  it depends on whether a collection ran (a run of `plib-options-copies.yaml` logged the hits).
  Advanced Mopping by Type and Ultimate Power Tweaks each give their copy's
  `OptionsDialog.FillModOptions` a postfix, and a mod's options open through its own copy: the
  second replacement enumerates its own `ICollection<IOptionsEntry>` through the other copy's
  `IEnumerable<IOptionsEntry>`. A mod that patches the dialog of every loaded copy breaks every
  copy's but the first, as in issue #14 (Better Farming Effects and Tweaks', Mod Updater's and
  Advanced Batteries' dialogs, in `FillModOptions_Patch1`; the reporter's patching mod is not
  known). Mono finds an implementation anyway: for
  `IEnumerable<T>`, `ICollection<T>`, `IList<T>` and `IEnumerator<T>` (its "array special
  interfaces", `class-init.c`), `mono_class_interface_offset_with_variance` (`class.c`; Unity's
  fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`) falls back to any instantiation of the same generic interface
  the object implements, so the call reaches `List<IOptionsEntry>`'s own enumerator and the
  dialog opens. CoreCLR's interface dispatch finds no implementation of the other instantiation
  and throws `EntryPointNotFoundException`. **Resolved in**
  `GenericMemberScopes`, a transpiler of `_ResolveReflection`: when a member's declaring type,
  or a type specification's element (an array of `List<IOptionsEntry>`), is built from a generic
  instantiation, the key also names the assembly and module of every type it is built from, so
  each copy's replacement gets its own types; other keys are left as they were. Where Mono's
  fallback ran the other copy's types (a `List<IOptionsEntry>` constructed in the replacement is
  of the other copy on Mono, and a generic interface outside those four fails there, "doesn't
  implement interface"), ours runs the replacement's own. `--check-types` patches two emitted
  copies' methods that enumerate a collection of their own interface, construct a list of it and
  name an array of such lists, and calls the second copy's; `tests/e2e/plib-options-copies.yaml`
  opens the two mods' options dialogs and two others'.
- **D34 Patches of methods code compiled before had inlined.** CoreCLR's JIT inlines small
  methods into the code it compiles at tier 1, and virtual ones it devirtualizes (by the
  receiver's exact type, or behind a check of the type tiered PGO saw). A patch marks its method
  not to be inlined from then on (D13), but code compiled before keeps the old body, so a patch
  made while the game runs never ran from there. A prefix on `Brain.UpdateBrain` added a minute
  into the early-base colony ran 0 times in a minute: the brain groups' loop, and
  `BrainScheduler.RenderEveryTick` around it, had tiered up with it inlined. The original ran it
  10,482 times, 3.00 per brain group update. Mono inlines only methods of under 20 bytes of IL
  without exception clauses, and a virtual one only if it is final
  (`mono_method_check_inlining`, `INLINE_LENGTH_LIMIT`; Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`), so there a late patch reaches every call but those to the smallest
  methods. Mods rarely patch late: of the 2821 Workshop mods in onimaxxing's decompile cache,
  about 11 make a first patch after the game world exists, and the target of two of them is a
  small method a hot caller inlines (Resource Calculator patches
  `KInputController.UpdateScrollStates`, 44 bytes, which `KInputController.Update` calls every
  frame from boot, on the first `Game.OnSpawn`; Interstellar patches
  `DebugHandler.get_NotificationsDisabled` while it builds new worlds). PLib's stages that can
  run after a colony (`InMainMenu`, `OnStartGame`, `OnEndGame`) apply no patch in any of them.
  Test tools patch late as well (E2eDriver's `seed` and `count`, PerfProbe). **Resolved in**
  `PatchInliners` and `PatchDependents`: Harmony's MonoMod hands the JIT a wrapper of its
  `ICorJitInfo` (managed JIT hook), and the host replaces the wrapper's `reportInliningDecision`
  slot, so it records, for each method compiled, the methods its code inlined, from the JIT's own
  decisions (no IL is read). The first time a method is patched, the code recorded as inlining it
  is rebuilt: a Harmony replacement with its patches (as D21 rebuilds one), and a method of the
  game or a mod as a copy, a Harmony replacement without patches built from its own IL, which
  calls the patched method. The copy is marked not to be inlined, as a patched method is, and
  Harmony replaces it when the method itself is patched. A compile that was under way when a patch
  went in is rebuilt once it has finished. Not covered (logged): type initializers, shared generic
  code (its MethodBase is over `__Canon`), Harmony's and the host's own methods; ReadyToRun code,
  the BCL's precompiled methods, which inline one another without the JIT (a patch of a BCL
  method misses those calls at any time); and macOS, where MonoMod hooks the JIT natively and
  hands it no wrapper. Cost: none measured. The record is made at compile time only: U57 reached
  the main menu in 8.6 and 8.4 s with it, 8.5 and 8.3 s without, and four `qa.sh perf` runs
  alternating with and without gave 30.1 and 39.3 fps with it, 27.4 and 36.1 without (other
  sessions loaded the machine; the spread between pairs is wider than any difference). Nothing
  patches late there, so no copy is made. The late prefix on `Brain.UpdateBrain` found 3 of the
  9677 methods recorded in 1.5 ms. A copy runs as any Harmony replacement does (optimized at
  once, without tiered PGO), and only after a late patch of a method it inlined. `--check-types` runs two loops compiled optimized at once, one
  inlining a static method, the other a sealed class's override through a small method compiled
  only inlined, patches both methods, and checks that the prefixes run, and that a later patch of
  a loop replaces its copy; `tests/e2e/late-patch.yaml` counts the late prefix on
  `Brain.UpdateBrain` against the brain groups' updates.
- **D35 Strings of fields and events.** Mono prints a field as its type's full name and its name
  (`RuntimeFieldInfo.ToString`, `String.Format("{0} {1}", FieldType, name)`), an event likewise
  (`RuntimeEventInfo.ToString`, `EventHandlerType + " " + Name`; Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`). CoreCLR prints the type's short name when it is a primitive or a nested
  type, or an array or pointer of one (`Type.FormatTypeName`): `Int32 NO_LIGHT` where Mono prints
  `System.Int32 NO_LIGHT`. Harmony transpilers find the instructions they change by comparing
  `operand.ToString()` with Mono's string. Darkness Not Excluded Relit's patch of
  `Workable.GetEfficiencyMultiplier` (Lit Workspace) looks for `System.Int32 NO_LIGHT`: in the
  original it matches; here it matched nothing, the mod logged an error and the game quit at
  start-up. Methods, constructors, properties, parameters and locals print alike on both
  runtimes. Of the Workshop builds in `out/ws`, three hold such a string: that mod and both builds
  of Delivery Temperature Limit (`int` fields in its transpilers of fetch and status-item code).
  **Resolved in** `MonoMemberStrings`: prefixes on CoreLib's `RuntimeFieldInfo.ToString` and
  `RuntimeEventInfo.ToString` print them as Mono does, for the whole process as on Mono; an event
  without an add method still throws as CoreCLR's does. CoreCLR caches a field's string and
  Mono does not; neither does ours. `--check-types` prints fields of a primitive, a nested type,
  an array, a constant and an event of a nested delegate, and transpiles a method by the field's
  Mono string.
- **D36 Log size.** Unity's `Player.log` has no cap, and a mod throwing on every frame filled one
  player's log to 2 GB (issue #15). Kept on purpose: the engine's log (`CappedLogFile`) keeps its
  first 20 MB as written and, past them, only the last 20 MB or so, behind a banner of dashes
  saying how many bytes were cut there; the file stays under about 60 MB. `ONI_LOG_FULL=1`
  turns the cap off.
- **D37 Exception strings with inner exceptions.** Mono's `Exception.ToString` continues the
  outer message on its line: `Outer: message ---> Inner: message`, then the inner frames.
  .NET's starts ` ---> Inner: message` on a line of its own. A mod that logs
  `"…: " + exception` writes one line in the original's log where ours has two (Reversible
  Heater Clones logs so the two patches that fail in both players). Kept: it is log text, and
  the frames below it differ between the runtimes anyway (Mono's `[0x…] in <mvid>:0`). The
  test tools' log signatures (`qa-tools.py`) join such a line onto the one before it, so the
  two players' logs give the same signature; the load sweep had counted the second line as an
  error only ours logged.
- **D38 Patches of a generic class's code shared over a value type argument.** CoreCLR shares a
  generic class's code among the instantiations whose type arguments differ only in reference
  types, also when other arguments are value types: every state machine's
  `StateMachine<…>.Parameter<float>.Set` runs one body, `Parameter<__Canon, __Canon, __Canon,
  __Canon, float>.Set`. Mono's JIT shares code only when every type argument is a reference type
  (`mono_method_is_generic_sharable_full`, `mini-generic-sharing.c`: partial sharing, over
  primitive and enum arguments, is for full AOT or the `partial-sharing` debug option; Unity's
  fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`), so there each such instantiation has code of its own, and a
  Harmony patch of one runs for that one alone. Harmony builds the replacement for the
  instantiation patched, with that instantiation's types where the shared code looks them up in
  the object's own; detoured onto the shared code, it ran for every other instantiation, whose
  objects fail its casts. Critter Condo Save Fix prefixes the critter condo monitor's
  `Parameter<float>.Set`: every state machine's float parameter then threw InvalidCastException
  (`Context[FetchChore+States,…]` to `Context[CritterCondoInteractMontior,…]`), and loading a save
  failed (issue #16, from `Rottable.Instance`'s constructor). The original loads it.
  **Resolved in** `SharedInstantiations`, a prefix of Harmony's `PatchTools.DetourMethod`: the
  shared code of an instance method of a class instantiated over a value type and a type it
  shares code over is detoured to a dispatcher. An object of the patched instantiation (or of a
  class derived from it) runs its replacement; one of another instantiation runs that
  instantiation's replacement when Harmony patched it too, else a copy of its own IL, made the
  first time it is called (as D34 makes a copy, which D34 rebuilds when a method it inlined is
  patched later). The dispatcher takes `this` as an object: typed as the instantiation, the JIT
  takes the type check for granted. A struct's method, a static method and a generic method take
  their instantiation as a hidden argument, which a dispatcher cannot read: they are left as
  they were, logged. Instantiations over reference types only share code on both runtimes (D18)
  and are left as they were. A call through the dispatcher costs a type check and an indirect
  tail call, and for an instantiation other than the patched one a lookup of the object's type.
  Cost at load: none measured. U57 patches no such method (PerfProbe is its only mod), and the
  prefix looks once at each patched method's type arguments; in alternating runs, while other
  sessions ran 2 to 6 players, U57 reached the main menu in 20.1, 16.7, 20.0 and 19.9 s with it,
  16.6, 15.6, 22.1, 21.2 and 17.9 s without, and loaded in 44.9, 35.6, 40.0 and 39.9 s with it,
  37.0, 25.5, 40.1, 44.4 and 46.8 s without. `--check-types` patches an emitted
  `Outer<string>.Param<float>.Set`, which casts its object to `Ctx<A, V>`, calls it for string, a
  class derived from it, Version and Uri past tier-up, then patches Uri's too;
  `tests/e2e/mods/3773818206-critter-condo-save-fix.yaml` tames a hatch that used a condo,
  saves, loads the save through the Load screen and reads how long its monitor waits.
- **D39 Order of fields and properties.** Mono lists a type's fields and properties class by
  class from the type to its bases, each class's in its metadata order
  (`ves_icall_RuntimeType_GetFields_native` and `GetPropertiesByName_native`, `icall.c`, over
  `mono_class_get_fields_lazy` and `mono_class_get_properties`; Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`). CoreCLR walks the classes in the same order, but lists a class's instance
  fields, then its static fields, then its constants (`RuntimeTypeCache.PopulateFields`). And on
  CoreCLR only, Harmony's MonoMod sorts the cached field and property lists of each type that the
  IL of a method it patches names by metadata token (`ReflectionHelper.FixReflectionCache`, from
  `MethodBodyReader` and `DynamicMethodDefinition`; on Mono it finds no such cache and does
  nothing), across classes and assemblies, so a base class's members can come first, depending on
  what has been patched. Measured in both players (tools/UnityProbe,
  `PROBE_SCENARIO=memberorder`, at the main menu with OniMcp and E2eDriver loaded): of the
  game's 20,700 types (Assembly-CSharp and firstpass), GetFields with every flag listed the same
  fields in another order for 789 (732 within a class, 57 across classes), GetFields of instance
  fields for 114 and GetProperties for 50 (both across classes). Methods, events,
  nested types and constructors come in the same order (for the game's classes; System.Object's
  methods are each class library's). The order matters where the game numbers or creates things
  in it. `StateMachine.CreateStates` numbers a state machine's parameters in its fields' order:
  with Critter Condo Save Fix, whose patch of `CritterCondoInteractMontior.FindCondoTarget` names
  the monitor's fields, its parameters were masterTarget and remainingSecondsForEffect here and
  the other way round in the original. Saves match parameters by name, so they load either way;
  the order they are written in, and a mod reading a parameter by position, differed. Without
  mods, the 216 state machines of the early-base colony number theirs as the original does.
  `MyAttributeManager` finds or adds, and then spawns, the components of a component's `MyCmpAdd`,
  `MyCmpGet` and `MyCmpReq` fields in the fields' order, keeping the first field of a name: with
  only the host's and the test mods' patches, Navigator, SuitLocker and HighEnergyParticle had
  their StateMachineController (their base class's field) found and spawned before their own
  components. KSerialization (one class at a time, instance fields), Db's
  `ResourceSet.ResolveReferences` (by name) and GameComps (one class's static fields) come out
  alike. **Resolved in** `MonoReflectionOrder`: postfixes on CoreLib's
  `RuntimeType.GetFields(BindingFlags)` and `GetProperties(BindingFlags)` reorder each result
  (`OniMoono.Engine.MonoMemberOrder`): class by class from the type to its bases, each class's by
  metadata token; a result already in that order is left as it is. That is for the whole
  process, as on Mono, and covers the overloads that call them (`GetFields()`,
  `TypeInfo.DeclaredFields`, `FindMembers`). The members stay CoreCLR's: where the class libraries
  differ (System.Delegate's properties, the engine's classes' private fields), so do the lists.
  MonoMod's sort is left alone. Not covered: `GetMembers` and `GetMember` (no game code calls
  them). Kept: `GetInterfaces` (Mono walks a hash table of interfaces keyed by type token,
  CoreCLR its interface map; 1981 game types differ) and custom attributes (CoreCLR returns
  pseudo-attributes such as `[Serializable]` first, Mono last; 1432 types), which the game looks
  up by type, never by position. Cost: none measured. Starting, loading U57 (56 s while other
  sessions ran four players) and playing 10 s made 276,000 calls, which spent 20 ms in the
  postfixes all told (timed in them). A list in order is checked and left; one MonoMod sorted is
  sorted again on each call: GetFields of 130 instance fields over five classes takes 2.4 µs
  instead of 0.8. `--check-types` patches a method of a class whose fields and
  properties, and its base's, interleave instance, static and constant ones, and lists them;
  `MonoMemberOrderTests` sorts the probe's types as the original lists them.
- **D40 Methods naming a type its assembly no longer has.** A mod built for an older game names
  types the game has since renamed or removed: Endless Science fix's progress-bar prefix calls
  `Worker Workable.get_worker()`, and `Worker` became `WorkerBase`. Both runtimes fail such a
  method as a whole when it is compiled, at every call, before any of it runs, but report it
  differently (measured in both players with `tools/UnityProbe`, `PROBE_SCENARIO=missingtypes`,
  a library built with a type and run without it). Mono throws a TypeLoadException from the
  caller's frame, the failing method having none in the trace. Its message depends on where the
  JIT meets the type (`mini/method-to-ir.c`; Unity's fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`): where it
  keeps the resolution's error, "Could not resolve type with token 01000071 from typeref
  (expected class 'Worker' in assembly 'Assembly-CSharp, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
  PublicKeyToken=null')" (`mono_class_from_typeref_checked`, `metadata/class.c`): exception
  clauses and locals, read first with the method's header, then calls, newobj, ldftn and jmp on
  a member reference or a generic method's arguments, ldtoken and calli; where it drops it
  (`CHECK_TYPELOAD`), "Failure has occurred while loading a type.": the type operands (castclass,
  isinst, newarr, box and the rest), fields, and a call to the mod's own method whose signature
  names the type. The first such place in IL order decides. CoreCLR's trace starts at the
  failing method, and it says "Method not found: 'Worker Workable.get_worker()'.", "Field not
  found: …" or "Could not load type 'Worker' from assembly …"; a call to the mod's own method
  with such a signature fails in the method called, after the caller has run. Endless Science fix
  fails in both players when a Duplicant starts its work, but ours logged a signature the
  original lacks. **Resolved in** `MonoMissingTypes`, after `MonoNestedTypeRefs` as `ModAccess`
  loads a mod: each method that names, in that order, a top-level type missing from an assembly
  already loaded whose types both players share (a mod's, or the game's own from `Managed/`,
  not Mono's class libraries; of Unity's engine and packages, which ours replace, a type that
  both ours and Unity's copy in `Managed/` lack: Delivery Temperature Limit's copy of PLib names
  `TMPro.FaceInfo`, which TextMeshPro no longer has) gets the body Mono's compilation
  gives it, throwing Mono's exception with the token of the mod's file, and is hidden from stack
  traces (`StackTraceHidden`), so the trace starts at its caller as Mono's does. Members
  missing from a type that exists are D42's. Not covered: missing nested types (D32 binds
  some of them), and assemblies not loaded yet when the mod loads; a method whose own signature
  names a missing type fails in its callers only. A mod that cannot be rewritten loads unchanged.
  `--check-types` loads a mod whose method calls a game method by a missing return type behind a
  branch not taken, one whose isinst names the missing type, and one constructing
  `TMPro.FaceInfo`.
- **D41 The calling assembly of a patch method.** Harmony calls a mod's prefixes, postfixes and
  finalizers from the replacement it builds for the patched method, a dynamic method owned by
  MonoMod's `DynamicMethodDefinition` (in 0Harmony). Mono's `Assembly.GetCallingAssembly` walks
  past wrapper frames, dynamic methods among them, and past CoreLib's `System.Reflection`
  (`get_caller_no_reflection`, `metadata/icall.c`; Unity's fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`), so a
  patch method that asks is told the assembly of the code that called the patched method.
  Measured in the original player (tools/UnityProbe, `PROBE_SCENARIO=callingasm`: patched
  members of the probe called from an emitted assembly): prefixes and postfixes of a method and
  of constructors, one of them called from the other's replacement and one through
  `MethodInfo.Invoke`, name the caller's assembly; through `Activator.CreateInstance`, mscorlib.
  CoreCLR stops at the replacement and names 0Harmony, unless the JIT made the call to the patch
  method a tail call (a postfix last in a replacement that returns nothing), which leaves no
  replacement frame. Mod Origin Info's postfixes on the constructors of `ComplexRecipe`,
  `GeyserType` and `Spice` look up the mod by that assembly: in the early-base colony with Smol
  Generators and Roller Snakes Reborn they recorded no modded recipe, where the original records
  6, and 17 modded things where it records 23. **Resolved in** `MonoCallingAssembly`: a postfix
  on CoreLib's `GetCallingAssembly`, for the whole process as on Mono, walks the stack as Mono
  does whenever CoreCLR's answer is 0Harmony (the owner of every replacement): past the asking
  method, the first frame that is neither a dynamic method nor in CoreLib's `System.Reflection`,
  nor CoreLib's `RuntimeMethodHandle`, whose `InvokeMethod` calls a method invoked by reflection
  where Mono's runtime-invoke wrapper does (the probe's first `MethodInfo.Invoke` in our player).
  The probe then reports as the original does in every case but the one below.
  `GetExecutingAssembly` names the patch method's assembly on both runtimes (D19 keeps its
  frame), and `new StackTrace()` lists the replacement's frame on both (D23). Not covered: a call
  in a patched method's own body, which runs in the replacement: Mono names 0Harmony there (the
  owner's assembly, measured), ours the caller's; dynamic methods owned elsewhere (a mod's own),
  which Mono walks past too; a caller whose call is a tail call. Once a method is optimized
  (tier 1, or with tiered compilation off), CoreCLR's JIT makes a call right before `ret` a
  tail call, so the caller's frame is gone and its own caller is named, with or without Harmony
  (`--check-types` named the host for `call Who; ret` and for `callvirt Invoke; ret` once they
  tiered up, `DOTNET_TieredPGO=0` or `DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0`). Mono keeps that frame (the
  probe's `CallWho` has that shape). Cost: none measured. With the postfix, a call to a method returning
  `GetCallingAssembly()` takes 400 ns, as without it (release build); the walk, made only for
  Harmony's replacements and 0Harmony's own calls, 9 to 15 µs at 25 frames. `--check-types`
  patches an emitted game's two constructors, one calling the other, and a method, and calls
  them from a third assembly, directly and through reflection, past tier-up, from callers that
  use each result after the call, so none of their calls is a tail call;
  `tests/e2e/mods/3757075889-mod-origin-info.yaml` compares the mod's records with the
  original's.
- **D42 Methods naming a member its type no longer has.** A mod built for an older game calls
  methods or reads fields the game has since removed or retyped: Trapdoors & Floor Hatches' OnSpawn
  calls `SimMessages.SetCellProperties(int, byte)`. As for a missing type (D40), both runtimes fail
  the method naming it as a whole when it is compiled, but word it differently. Mono keeps the
  member lookup's error (`CHECK_CFG_ERROR` in `mini/method-to-ir.c`; Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`) and throws it from the caller's frame: "Method not found: void
  .SimMessages.SetCellProperties(int,byte)" (`mono_error_set_method_missing`,
  `metadata/exception.c`): the return type, the class's namespace, '.' (also when the namespace is
  empty, so a nested class is ".Inner"), its name ("Box`1" for a generic one), '.', the method's
  name, "<!0,…>" for a generic method, and the parameters joined by ',', each as
  `mono_type_get_desc` writes it (`metadata/debug-helpers.c`: int, byte, single, string, int&,
  string[,], `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2<string, int[]>`, Outer/Inner, !0 for a type
  parameter, !!0 for a method's). A field: "Field not found: int .GlobalKeeper.Field Due to: Could
  not find field in class" (`field_from_memberref`, `metadata/loader.c`), a field of the same name
  but another type included. Measured in the original player (`tools/UnityProbe`,
  `PROBE_SCENARIO=missingmembers`: 30 cases, among them static, instance and virtual methods, a
  constructor, a property, a changed parameter type, generic types and methods, nested types,
  by-ref and array parameters and fields; the first missing type or member in IL order decides,
  as in D40). CoreCLR says "Method not found: 'Void SimMessages.SetCellProperties(Int32,
  Byte)'." from the failing method's own frame. The game logs the exception as
  `KMonoBehaviour.Spawn` catches it, with `DebugUtil.LogExceptionCallstack(…, e.ToString(), e)`:
  the message and the exception's frames. On Mono the failing method has no frame, so the trace
  is `at KMonoBehaviour.Spawn ()` alone; ours started with `LadderHatch.OnSpawn()`, which made the
  log signature (message and first frame past the runtime's) one the original lacks.
  **Resolved in** `MonoMissingMembers`, in `MonoMissingTypes`' pass as a mod loads: each member
  reference whose type exists in an assembly the same in both players (D40), but has no member of
  that name and signature in it or its bases (a constructor in the type alone; an interface's
  methods in the interfaces it extends, then System.Object), looked up with reflection over the
  types loaded here, gets Mono's message, and each method naming one gets the body Mono's
  compilation gives it: it throws MissingMethodException or MissingFieldException with that
  message, hidden from stack traces. The engine's Unity-format trace of a logged exception
  (`LogTraces`) now leaves hidden frames out too, as `Exception.StackTrace` does. The probe then
  reports as the original does, but for the trace's format (CoreCLR's "   at A.B()", which the
  log signatures already treat alike). Not covered: members of Unity's engine and packages and of
  the class libraries (our API's gaps: D40's assemblies), member references whose signature names
  a type not resolvable when the mod loads (the mod's own, another mod's not loaded yet: they
  fail as CoreCLR fails them), vararg and function-pointer signatures. A member the lookup finds
  is one the runtime binds: across the 2,119 Workshop mods in `out/ws` (2,890 assemblies, 2.2
  million member references), none of the 2,089 references the lookup reports missing resolved on
  CoreCLR (`Module.ResolveMember`), and those CoreCLR could not resolve that it passed over name
  Unity's or the class libraries' members or a missing type (D40). Cost: the lookup over those
  assemblies took 3.4 s, 1.2 ms an assembly (release build); it reads metadata, and Cecil reads
  only a mod that names a missing type or member.
  `--check-types` loads a mod calling `SimMessages.SetCellProperties(int, byte)` behind a branch
  not taken, a generic game type's instance method by a by-ref array of its parameter, a generic
  method and a nested type's field the game lacks, and two members it has (one on a base class).
- **D43 A join reached with values on the stack from one side only.** ECMA-335 requires every
  path into an instruction to bring the same stack depth; CoreCLR's JIT refuses a method where
  one does not (InvalidProgramException when Harmony applies the patch). Mono's JIT checks only
  the paths that bring values: a block left with an empty stack hands its successors nothing
  (`handle_stack_args` in `mini/method-to-ir.c` returns at once for no values), so a join that
  one path reaches with values and another with none compiles, and the code after it, valid with
  the empty stack, never takes them. Transpilers that insert a test branching back with the
  tested value still on the stack produce such methods: Fixes and Tweaks' patch of
  `Timelapser.SetPostionAndOrtho` jumps to its `foreach`'s head with a `BuildingComplete` left
  over, and the mod failed to load (it loads in the original). **Resolved by a patch** of the
  game's Harmony (`TranspiledStackJoins`, run before D17's pass on the same
  `CodeTranspiler.GetResult`): where the stack depths of the instructions its transpilers produce
  disagree only so, each path bringing values to a join reached with an empty stack elsewhere
  pops them on its way (before an unconditional branch, after the instruction falling through,
  or in a trampoline for a conditional branch). A method whose depths differ otherwise (two
  non-empty depths, a switch, code after the join taking the values) is left as it was, and
  each change is logged. `--check-types` transpiles a `foreach` so and runs it.
- **D44 Nested types named with '/'.** Mono's lookup of a class by name takes '/' between a
  nested type and its outer type as well as '+' (`metadata/class.c`: the name is split at its
  first '/', and `return_nested_in` follows the rest one '/' at a time), so
  `Assembly.GetType("Outer/Inner")` finds `Outer+Inner`, as ILDasm and Cecil spell it. CoreCLR's
  type name parser takes '+' only and returns null: Delivery Temperature Limit looks up
  `FetchAreaChore/StatesInstance/<>c__DisplayClass17_0` to patch a lambda of the game's, logged
  an error the game reports with its error dialog, and the game quit (it loads in the original).
  **Resolved in** `MonoNestedTypeNames`: a prefix of CoreLib's
  `RuntimeAssembly.GetType(string, bool, bool)`, which every `Assembly.GetType` overload calls,
  spells a '/' as '+' (no CLR type name holds one otherwise). `Type.GetType` is left as it is.
  `--check-types` finds a nested type of a nested type so, ignoring case too, and a missing one
  as before.
- **D45 References to an assembly another mod loaded.** Measured in the original player with
  UnityProbe's binding probe (`AssemblyBinding.cs`, mods built by `tools/UnityProbe/Binding`),
  read with Mono's `metadata/assembly.c` and `appdomain.c` (Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`). A mod's reference binds first to an assembly already loaded, searched in
  load order (`mono_domain_assembly_search`): without a strong name, the first loaded under its
  simple name, ignoring case, whatever the versions (PLib 4.8.1 references bind to another mod's
  PLib 4.22, as D15 has it); with one, the first of the same identity (version and key). Then the
  requesting mod's folder, whose file is taken whatever its version. Then AppDomain's
  AssemblyResolve, whose first handler is one Unity's player registers (UnityEngine's
  `ClassLibraryInitializer`): it loads the simple name, so a strong-named reference to another
  version or key binds to the first assembly loaded under that name too, and failing that the
  event is raised again with the simple name and no requesting assembly, before the other
  handlers see the full name. KMod's `Assembly.LoadFrom` of a strong-named file gives the
  loaded assembly of its identity, and a file of another version of it loads beside it
  (`GetAssemblies` lists both; a reference of that version binds to it); a mod's own
  `Assembly.LoadFrom` behaves as KMod's; `Assembly.Load(byte[])` always loads a new copy, as in
  CoreCLR. CoreCLR fails strong-named references to other versions than the one loaded, refuses
  a second file of a loaded name (KMod then drops the mod, even for a copy of the same version
  but another build), and raises AssemblyResolve once. **Resolved in** `ModAccess`: references
  bind as above (the default context's Resolving event, then an AssemblyResolve handler
  registered before any mod's, which takes the folder, the simple name and then raises the
  event again through `AssemblyLoadContext.OnAssemblyResolve`); a strong-named file of another
  identity loads in a context of its own; a prefix of `Assembly.LoadFrom(string)` gives a mod's
  own loads what KMod's get. Not covered: a strong-named reference whose other version sits in
  the requesting mod's folder while one is loaded binds to the loaded one in ours (Mono loads the
  file); and once a strong-named name has bound to the first loaded version, CoreCLR keeps that
  binding for the default context, so a reference of that name after its own version loads
  beside binds to the first still (Mono binds it to the new one). No mod in the Workshop
  catalogue ships such a file: its strong-named libraries at a mod's
  top level are copies of what the game or another mod ships (Newtonsoft.Json 7.0, YamlDotNet 15).
  The load sweep's Stacking bed difference (`s2000`) was not this: ours's batch failed through
  another mod, and bisecting left Stacking bed in a half without a mod that ships PLib.
  `--check-types` loads a strong-named copy, another version beside it, references to both
  versions and to a third, a mod's `Assembly.LoadFrom` of another version, and a reference to a
  missing assembly, and checks the AssemblyResolve events.
- **D46 NativeArray ranges.** Measured in the original player with UnityProbe's range probe
  (`NativeRanges.cs`): nothing on `NativeArray` checks a range or throws for one. The indexer
  reads and writes the memory before or past the array; `GetSubArray` gives views before or
  past it (a negative length gives a negative `Length`); the two-array `Copy`, `CopyFrom` and
  `CopyTo` copy the source's length whatever the destination's, past a managed array's end
  too, and the five-argument `Copy` the length given, before or past either array. A negative
  length writes garbage over a NativeArray and crashed the player into a managed array. The
  game's `RangeVisualizerEffect.OnPostRender` writes past an occlusion texture's
  `GetPixelData` array when a range outgrows the texture (Zoned Auto Sweeper's zone mode), and
  the original carries on. **Kept safe, without exceptions:** an out-of-range write is dropped
  and a read gives `default(T)`; the copies copy only the part within both arrays (nothing for
  a negative length); `GetSubArray` past the end is cut to the array, and one with a negative
  start or length is empty. The first one in a process is logged with its stack. An array that
  is not created or is disposed still throws. In-range access costs what it did (the same
  compare).
- **D47 Thread.Abort.** Read in Mono's `metadata/threads.c` (Unity's fork, branch
  `unity-6000.3-mbe`): an abort of another thread marks it AbortRequested and wakes it, and
  ThreadAbortException ("Thread was being aborted") is raised at its next safe point, a wait or a
  system call included. It is raised again at the end of every catch that takes it until the
  thread calls ResetAbort, finally blocks run, and a thread it ends ends quietly (no
  UnhandledException). An abort of a thread that has ended or is being aborted already does
  nothing; one of a thread not started marks it, and its Start then does not run it; one of the
  current thread throws at once. CoreCLR has none of it: Abort and ResetAbort throw
  PlatformNotSupportedException on the caller. KleiMetrics' StartSession ends a running session
  with ThreadedHttps.End, which aborts the session's HTTP thread when it has not stopped within
  2 s. With Klei's servers out of reach that thread is waiting to retry its post (16, 32 and
  64 s), and KleiAccount, giving up after the same retries, has Global.Update start a session
  again about two minutes in: CoreCLR threw from Global.Update and the game went to the crash
  reporter (issue #28). `scripts/e2e-klei-unreachable.sh` plays it
  (`tests/e2e/klei-unreachable.yaml`, with proxies that refuse connections for the players alone
  and a Steam double that gives a ticket). In the original, loading the colony started the session
  at 12:43:04, and its thread was in the 64 s wait when KleiAccount gave up at 12:44:42; 2.5 s
  later a new thread posted the new session (and gave up at 12:46:37), the old one was not heard
  from again, and play went on. In ours before the fix, the same timeline ended in the
  PlatformNotSupportedException from Global.Update and the crash reporter's screen; the new
  session never started, and the old thread's "Max Retries" never came: past its wait it takes
  Send's `if (shouldQuit) continue`, which posts again at once, with no line in the log and no
  end. **Resolved in** `MonoThreadAbort`: the calls of Thread.Abort, Abort(object) and ResetAbort
  in the game's assemblies and in mods are rewritten as they load (MonoConversions' pass). An
  abort marks the thread and interrupts it (Thread.Interrupt), so its next wait throws
  ThreadInterruptedException; in an assembly that calls Thread.Abort, every exit of a catch that
  could take it (of object, Exception, SystemException, ThreadAbortException or
  ThreadInterruptedException, or with a filter) calls `CatchEnd` first, which throws
  ThreadAbortException while the thread is being aborted, as Mono's re-raise does
  (ThreadedHttps.Send's catch goes back to retry: without it the thread posts again, forever).
  ResetAbort ends the abort and takes back an interrupt not raised yet. The exception that ends
  the thread is dropped quietly (UnhandledExceptions, D16). Aborting the current thread throws
  ThreadAbortException with Mono's message at the call; one of an ended thread does nothing. The
  game has 155 such catch exits (39 in Assembly-CSharp-firstpass, 116 in Assembly-CSharp), each a
  static read when no thread is being aborted. Only direct calls (call, callvirt) are rewritten,
  and catch exits only in an assembly with such a call of Thread.Abort. Load time, measured on the
  game's assemblies: the metadata filter that skips an assembly without such a reference takes
  0.2–7 ms (0Harmony, Assembly-CSharp); the pass over one that has it 7–25 ms for
  Assembly-CSharp-firstpass and 36–56 ms for Assembly-CSharp, once, as the game's rewritten images
  are cached; a mod with such a call is rewritten at each load, as for D29. `--check-types` aborts
  threads waiting in Sleep, a wait handle, Monitor.Wait, Join, a task's Result and an HTTP request
  to a server that never answers (each ends at once, quietly, and the call returns at once), the
  current thread, an ended one and one not started, and a mod's retry loop like Send's and a catch
  that calls ResetAbort. With the fix the spec passes in both players: the session's thread, in
  its 64 s wait, ends at the abort (the engine log's "Thread.Abort" lines, interrupted and then
  ended by its ThreadInterruptedException, nothing between them), and a new thread posts the new
  session 2.3 s after KleiAccount gave up, and gives up after its own retries, as in the original.
  **Differs from Mono:** the exception at the wait is ThreadInterruptedException, so a catch of
  ThreadAbortException alone does not take it there (only the re-raise at a catch's end), and `e
  is ThreadAbortException` is false for it: ONITwitch's connection thread logs "An unexpected
  exception occurred" rather than "Thread aborted", and Truthful Thermal Conductivity's long-click
  thread ends without its empty catch running (it ends either way). A thread that does not wait is
  not stopped: a loop without waits, or a system call (a socket's Receive is measured to go on
  until the socket closes). A catch in an assembly that does not call Thread.Abort is not followed
  by a re-raise, and the one interrupt can land in a wait in a finally block, which Mono's abort
  leaves alone. ThreadState never shows AbortRequested, ExceptionState is null (Abort(object)'s
  state is lost), a thread aborted before its start runs and its first wait is interrupted, and
  the main thread's own abort throws at the call without being followed. A delegate of
  Thread.Abort, or a call through reflection, still throws PlatformNotSupportedException.
- **D48 Serialized delegates.** Read in Mono's `System/Delegate.cs` and
  `DelegateSerializationHolder.cs` (Unity's fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`): Delegate is
  ISerializable, and its GetObjectData (MulticastDelegate's calls it) writes, for each delegate of
  the invocation list, a DelegateEntry chained to the one before it ("Delegate" holds the first;
  private fields type, assembly, target, targetTypeAssembly, targetTypeName and methodName, public
  `delegateEntry`), the target as "target<n>" when there is one, and the method as "method<n>",
  and sets the info's type to DelegateSerializationHolder, which gives the delegate back. A
  RuntimeMethodInfo is ISerializable too, and writes MemberInfoSerializationHolder's entries (Name,
  AssemblyName, ClassName, Signature, Signature2, MemberType, GenericArguments). Newtonsoft.Json
  writes an ISerializable value as an object of its GetObjectData entries, so on Mono an object
  holding a delegate serializes. Measured in the original player with UnityProbe's delegate probe
  (`DelegateJson.cs`, `PROBE_SCENARIO=delegatejson`) through the game's Newtonsoft.Json 7.0.1: a
  holder of `Func<int,int>` writes `"Fn":{"Delegate":{"delegateEntry":null},"method0":{"Name":"Twice",
  "AssemblyName":"…","ClassName":"…","Signature":"Int32 Twice(Int32)","Signature2":"System.Int32
  Twice(System.Int32)","MemberType":8,"GenericArguments":null}}`; an instance method's and a
  closure's add `"target0"`, the target's own serialization (`{"Add":3,"Label":"target"}`, the
  display class's captured fields, `{}` for a lambda capturing nothing); a multicast one nests
  `delegateEntry` once per delegate and writes `method0`, `target1`, `method1`, … in list order; a
  generic method's GenericArguments are its type arguments' assembly-qualified names (mscorlib's).
  The same with Formatting.Indented and ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore; none throws. Reading the JSON
  back throws (JsonSerializationException: the delegate type has no serialization constructor), and
  BinaryFormatter round-trips a delegate whose targets are serializable. CoreCLR's GetObjectData
  throws SerializationException ("Serializing delegates is not supported on this platform"), and
  its RuntimeMethodInfo is not ISerializable (Newtonsoft fails on one with
  PlatformNotSupportedException): OniExtract's export of game data, a postfix of
  `LegacyModMain.Load`, threw, the game logged it from `Assets.OnPrefabInit` and quit through its
  crash dialog (issue #22). **Resolved in** `MonoDelegateSerialization`: a prefix of
  `Delegate.GetObjectData` and `MulticastDelegate.GetObjectData` writes Mono's entries, with
  Mono's field names and order, and D1's names for types (mscorlib's for the class libraries'
  types, the Unity modules' for the engine's). "method<n>" holds a MethodInfo standing for the
  delegate's method (it reflects as the method and invokes it) that writes Mono's
  RuntimeMethodInfo entries: Signature is `MethodInfo.ToString()`, the same in both runtimes,
  Signature2 the types' `ToString()` with by-ref ones as `T&` and type arguments as ToString
  prints them (`System.Int32 Same[Int32](System.Int32)`, as measured), and GenericArguments the
  type arguments' Mono names as strings, which Newtonsoft writes as it writes Mono's Types. The
  holder types give the delegate back through BinaryFormatter, the targets serialized as before.
  The probe's JSON is then the original's for every case and setting (static, instance and
  generic methods, multicast, closure, lambda; default, indented, loop-ignoring). Cost: none
  elsewhere: two patches on the host's patch thread (about 20 ms, off the main thread), and a
  delegate's serialization takes about 12 µs (release build). Tests: `MonoDelegateSerializationTests`.
  **Differs from Mono:** names a formatter takes from the runtime: with TypeNameHandling, `$type`
  names this runtime's types (`System.Private.CoreLib` for the delegate type, as for every class
  library type, and `OniMoono.Host.DelegateSerializationHolder+DelegateEntry, OniMoono` and the
  stand-in where Mono names `System.DelegateSerializationHolder+DelegateEntry, mscorlib` and
  `System.Reflection.RuntimeMethodInfo, mscorlib`, GenericArguments `System.String[]` for
  `System.Type[]`), the info's FullTypeName and AssemblyName (the host's holder), and
  BinaryFormatter's bytes. Code reading the entries itself gets the stand-in, not a
  RuntimeMethodInfo (`Delegate.CreateDelegate` refuses it), and GenericArguments as strings. A MethodInfo serialized alone (not in a delegate) still throws, as
  does a delegate to a dynamic method (Mono's throws NullReferenceException, its method having no
  declaring type).
- **D49 Type.GetType by a name without an assembly.** Both runtimes look such a name up in the
  caller's assembly, then in CoreLib (mscorlib), but take the caller differently. Mono
  (`type_from_parsed_name` and `get_caller_no_system_or_reflection`, `metadata/icall.c`; Unity's
  fork, branch `unity-6000.3-mbe`) walks past unmanaged frames, wrappers (a dynamic method is one)
  and mscorlib's `System` and `System.Reflection` namespaces to the first other frame; CoreCLR
  takes the method that called `GetType`. In a Harmony replacement, a dynamic method owned by
  MonoMod's `DynamicMethodDefinition`, CoreCLR therefore searches 0Harmony. The game's
  `SaveLoadRoot.LoadInternal` finds a building's optional components with
  `Type.GetType(name)`; Colony Cuisine and Auto Kitchen patch it, and in ours every rocket
  interior's ports then loaded without them ("AddComponent with a null type", 15 times in the
  2minnow colony), the rockets' doors lost their targets and the crash screen opened as the save
  loaded (`ColonyDiagnosticUtility.GetDiagnostic`: KeyNotFoundException); the original loads
  them. **Resolved in** `MonoTypeByName`: a finalizer of `Type.GetType(string)`,
  `(string, bool)` and `(string, bool, bool)`, for the whole process as on Mono, looks the name up
  in the assembly Mono's walk gives when CoreCLR's lookup found nothing (or threw a
  TypeLoadException) and that assembly is not the caller CoreCLR searched; a stack walk is made
  only for a failed lookup. Not covered: a name that both 0Harmony (or CoreLib) and Mono's
  assembly define is found in the former, as CoreCLR finds it; the overloads taking resolvers.
  `--check-types` patches a game method that calls `Type.GetType` for a type of its own assembly,
  and calls it from that assembly: CoreCLR alone threw "Could not resolve type 'CheckPort' in
  assembly '0Harmony'".
- **D50 Mods built to run in 32-bit processes only.** An IL-only image whose CLI header has
  `32BITREQUIRED` (an x86 build) loads in Mono's 64-bit player: Mono reads the flag only into the
  assembly name's processor architecture (`mono_assembly_fill_assembly_name_full`,
  `metadata/assembly.c`), and its image loader skips the machine check (`metadata/image.c`).
  CoreCLR refuses it in a 64-bit process ("The assembly architecture is not compatible with the
  current process architecture"), and KMod disabled 气体液体管道装载器 (3280526635, whose
  `TestMod.dll` is so built). **Resolved in** `ModAccess`: such a mod image loads from memory
  with the flag cleared, before its other passes, and its `Location` stays its file's; IL runs the
  same either way. An image with native code is left as it is (it cannot run here).
  `--check-types` loads an x86 IL-only image marked so (CoreCLR alone refuses it) and runs it.
- **D51 Types nested in `<Module>`.** Obfuscators nest types in the module's global type (the
  NestedClass table names TypeDef 1 as their enclosing class). Mono loads them as any nested
  type: `<Module>` is a class like the others. CoreCLR's table of the classes an assembly
  declares leaves `<Module>` out, so such a type, and every type nested in it, fails to load
  ("Enclosing type(s) not found for type … in assembly …", BadImageFormatException), and KMod
  disables the mod (Abyssalite's `Katairite.dll` nests 8 of its 15 types in `<Module>` and 3 in
  those, Refrigerator's `Refrigerator.dll` 8 of 16 and 4). **Resolved in** `ModuleNestedTypes`, before `MonoNestedTypeRefs`
  as `ModAccess` loads a mod: the types nested in `<Module>` become top-level types (public ones
  public, the others internal) with their own nested types, and `<Module>`'s private and
  protected members become internal, so the code that could reach them as nested types still
  can. Kept: those types' names lose their `<Module>+` prefix and their `DeclaringType` is null,
  where Mono's is `<Module>`. `--check-types` loads a mod whose type nested in `<Module>` holds a
  type calling a private method of `<Module>` (CoreCLR alone refuses it as it is), lists its
  types and runs it.
- **D52 Mods' serializable types in Instantiate.** Measured in the original player (UnityProbe,
  `PROBE_SCENARIO=emptycomposite`, `EmptyComposite.cs`): Unity's serializer handles a
  `[Serializable]` class or struct only from an assembly the game was built with
  (`ScriptingAssemblies.json`). As a field of a mod's MonoBehaviour, a mod's class (with or
  without serialized fields or a parameterless constructor), a mod's struct and a `List` of a mod's
  class are not copied by Instantiate: the copy keeps what its constructor gave it (null, the
  struct's default; no constructor of the field's type runs) and the source's field is left as it
  is, null included. The same component's ints, strings and `List<int>` are copied, and a field of
  the game's own class (`AttackEffect`) is copied, a null one given an instance in both (the
  engine's rule for the game's types). The engine had applied the game's rule to every type:
  Rephysicalized's `FueledDietController` keeps its diet, a mod class whose state is in private
  fields and get-only properties, in a public field set on the prefab, and takes it from a
  registry in `OnSpawn` only when the field is null; ours gave every Sea Turtle an empty diet, and
  `TryApplyFuelConversion` threw a NullReferenceException each time one ate. **Resolved in**
  `SerializedLayout.Known`: a field whose composite type (or collection element) is from neither
  the game's assemblies nor the engine is not part of a script's serialized layout, for
  Instantiate as for JsonUtility, which had the same rule measured. Not measured: a mod's enum
  (still copied as its integer).
- **D53 Patches of methods with a filter or fault clause.** MonoMod (inside 0Harmony) builds a
  replacement with a filter (`catch … when`) or fault clause as a MethodBuilder in a new dynamic
  assembly, not the DynamicMethod it builds for every other replacement (.NET Framework's
  DynamicMethod could not hold those clauses). That generator's code references
  `AssemblyBuilder.Save`, which CoreCLR lacks, so here such a patch threw MissingMethodException,
  and the background-save tweak's patch of `LoadScreen.MigrateFile` ended the player. **Resolved
  in** `PatchedFilters`: MonoMod's own switch (AppContext data `MonoMod.DMDType`, which a
  `MONOMOD_DMDType` environment variable still overrides) makes it build every replacement as a
  DynamicMethod, whose CoreCLR IL generator holds both clauses. Harmony 2.4.2 still cannot patch a
  method with a filter clause, on either runtime: it copies the clause with MonoMod's Cecil IL
  generator, which never sets the clause's handler start, so the exception block is ended with
  the filter still open and the IL generator throws InvalidOperationException ("Incorrect code
  generation for exception block"; Mono's `ILGenerator.EndExceptionBlock` checks for an open
  filter, and both of MonoMod's generators emit through `_DMDEmit.Generate`). `Harmony.Patch`
  throws it as on Mono, the method stays unpatched and the game goes on; background-save waits in
  `MigrateFile`'s callers instead. A fault clause patches as on Mono: Harmony's
  `FaultBlockRewriter` turns it into a catch and a finally and drops the fault block's code.
  `--check-types` patches an emitted method with a filter, expects that InvalidOperationException
  and calls the method unpatched, and patches one with a fault with a prefix and a postfix.
- **D54 The Vulkan device runs Unity's Vulkan programs and reports Vulkan.** U60's data carries
  Unity's own Vulkan programs (shader platform 18) for every shader, and the Vulkan device runs
  those, not the GLCore text, with Unity's Vulkan conventions (reversed Z, render textures
  rendered flipped; §3.5). `SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceType` is therefore `Vulkan` there, as on
  Unity's Vulkan player, so code that branches on it sees the conventions it renders with; it
  is `OpenGLCore` under the OpenGL device. `graphicsDeviceVersion` names Vulkan and the driver,
  and `graphicsDeviceName`, vendor and IDs are the Vulkan GPU's. Variants that sample through
  shadow-comparison or multisample textures, XR stereo (multiview) variants and programs with
  stages other than a vertex and a fragment stage are not drawn on Vulkan (logged once per
  shader); the game selects none of them. A shader without Vulkan programs U60's player reads
  (mods' bundles built with other Unity versions; docs/research/mod-bundle-shaders.md) runs its
  GLCore programs compiled to SPIR-V under the same conventions (§3.5, *Programs*). A device
  lost in play, or a window it can no longer present to, ends the game with an error (Unity's
  player does the same when its device is removed) that says how to choose OpenGL; nothing
  switches by itself. A start that never gets its first frames on screen makes auto use
  OpenGL for that GPU, driver and build (§3.5, *Starting*).
- **D55 Instance fields injected into patches of static methods.** A patch method's `___name`
  parameter gets the original's field `name`; Harmony emits `ldarg.0; ldfld name` for an instance
  field even when the original is static, so it reads the field's offset in whatever object the
  first argument is. Neither runtime checks the object's type there, and the two lay fields out
  differently. Fast Track's prefix of the static `IdleStates.MoveToNewCell(Instance smi)` (with
  its ReduceCritterIdleMove option) takes `___loop` and, for a critter off screen, sometimes calls
  `smi.GoTo(___loop)`. Measured in the original player with a probe prefix of the same shape on
  the prehistoric1 save: `___loop` is null for every critter kind there, so GoTo stops the idle
  state machine; ours read the instance's transition stack, GoTo pushed it on its
  `Stack<BaseState>`, and CoreCLR's array store check threw ArrayTypeMismatchException (issue
  #31: Klei's error dialog). **Resolved in** `MonoInstanceFieldInjection`: where Harmony injects
  an instance field into a patch of a static method whose first argument is not of the field's
  type, the object is checked at run time; one of the field's type is read as before, anything
  else gives the field type's default. Not matched: another layout's non-null read (none known),
  and a field taken by `ref`, left as Harmony emits it. `--check-types` patches an emitted static
  method taking another type, and one taking the field's own type.

## 3. The engine API (`OniMoono.UnityEngine`)

### 3.1 Surface rule

The public surface is **exactly** what the consumers reference, with Unity's names, member
kinds, signatures, `virtual`/`sealed`-ness, and base types, verified by `tools/ApiCheck`
(conformance gate, §9). We do not add public API Unity doesn't have. Internals are free-form.
Mods may call Unity API the game never does; types they are known to need are listed in
`engine-required-types.tsv`, and running `tools/ApiCheck` over a profile's mod assemblies finds
the members they reference that the engine lacks. `scripts/apisurface.sh` (`ApiCheck --surface`)
lists every public type and member of the shipped Unity assemblies that the engine and our
packages lack, and which of them the Workshop builds in `out/ws` reference.

The consumer set is: `Assembly-CSharp`, `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass`, `UnityEngine.UI`,
`Unity.TextMeshPro`, `Unity.Timeline`, `FMODUnity*`, `ImGui.NET`, Steamworks.NET.

Members are implemented **completely or not at all**. A member that is not yet implemented
does not exist; the runtime then fails with `MissingMethodException`, which names it exactly,
and ApiCheck lists it. There are no `throw new NotImplementedException()` placeholders and no
silent no-ops. Where Unity's behaviour is legitimately a no-op on this platform (e.g.
`Gizmos.*` in a player, `Handheld.*`), the member is implemented as that no-op with a comment
citing why.

### 3.2 Object model

- **Engine state lives on the "native side", never in managed fields of public types.** Like
  Unity, `UnityEngine.Object` has only private value-type fields: `IntPtr m_CachedPtr` (here a
  `GCHandle` to the engine's internal `NativeObject` record) and `int m_InstanceID`. Public
  engine classes (`GameObject`, `Component`, `Transform`, `Behaviour`, `MonoBehaviour`, …)
  declare **no other instance fields** unless Unity's own class declares them (e.g. the
  managed fields of `MonoBehaviour`). Reason: game code reflects over the full field set of
  components — `Localization.SetFont` walks `Instance|Public|NonPublic` fields recursively and
  follows `GameObject` fields into `GetComponents()` (*runtime §7.4*), and KSerialization builds
  templates over `Object`/`Component`/`Behaviour` fields with `GetCustomAttributes`. Managed
  back-references there would recurse forever or be serialized.
- The `NativeObject` record holds the alive/destroyed flag, name, hide flags, owning asset (if
  loaded from a file), and for GameObjects/Components the scene-graph data. **Fake-null
  semantics** follow Unity: `==`, `!=`, `op_Implicit(bool)` and `Equals` treat destroyed objects
  (and C#-created `UnityEngine.Object`s with no record) as null; these checks are lock-free
  reads usable from any thread.
- Value types used by saves keep Unity's exact field shape: `Vector2/3/4` (`x,y,z,w` public
  fields), `Color` (`r,g,b,a`), `Color32` (`r,g,b,a` bytes), `Quaternion` (`x,y,z,w`), and **no
  public settable instance properties** on `Color32`/`Vector4` (KSerialization's OptOut rule
  would serialize them). No full type name we define may also exist in a game assembly.
- `GameObject` owns an ordered component list; `Transform`/`RectTransform` is always first.
  `GetComponent*` matches by assignability, including interfaces, in component order.
  Lookups are cached per (GameObject, Type).
- **Activation and messages** follow Unity's player semantics (*usage §3*):
  - Message methods (`Awake`, `OnEnable`, `Start`, `Update`, `LateUpdate`, `FixedUpdate`,
    `OnDisable`, `OnDestroy`, `OnApplicationFocus/Quit`, `OnRenderImage`, `OnPreCull`,
    `OnPostRender`, `OnRectTransformDimensionsChange`, `OnTransformParentChanged`,
    `OnBecameVisible/Invisible`, `OnValidate` (editor-only: never), `OnGUI`, …) are discovered
    per type **by name, most-derived declaration only, any accessibility**, and bound once into
    open delegates. A base implementation runs only if the derived one calls it.
  - `Awake` runs when a component's GameObject first becomes active in hierarchy (or at
    load/instantiate time if already active), then `OnEnable`; `Start` runs before that
    component's first update callback, at the next Start pass or that callback, whichever
    comes first (§3.3). Activation and deactivation
    recurse in Unity's order (Awake/OnEnable for the whole subtree, parent first; OnDisable
    children-first when deactivating). Deactivation, and the same step of a destruction, walks
    the subtree: an object's `activeInHierarchy` turns false when the walk reaches it, then its
    children are walked, then its own `OnDisable`s run. While one object's `OnDisable` runs, its
    later siblings still read active, and deactivating one of them disables it there and then
    (UnityProbe's deactorder; the details panel's storage rows, issue #23).
  - `Destroy` is deferred to the end of the frame; `DestroyImmediate` is synchronous,
    children first, with `OnDisable` then `OnDestroy`. The GameObject passed to either turns
    inactive itself (`activeSelf` false) before its subtree's callbacks, its descendants keeping
    their own flag, and a component destroyed alone leaves its object active (UnityProbe's
    destroyflags): `KMonoBehaviour.OnDestroy` releases the object's `KObject` event system only
    on `!activeSelf`. A `Destroy` made by an `OnDestroy` while requests are carried out waits for
    the next destruction point (UnityProbe's destroycascade).
  - Exceptions in a message are logged through `Debug.LogException` and do not stop the frame,
    as in Unity.
- **Script execution order** comes from `MonoScript.m_ExecutionOrder` in
  `globalgamemanagers.assets`; within one order, update order is the order components' activation
  began (or they were enabled later), matching Unity's behaviour list. Pending `Start` calls are not sorted by it: they run in
  the order the behaviours were scheduled (became active and enabled), as Unity's delayed-call
  queue does.
- `ScriptableObject` and `MonoBehaviour` instances are created with
  `RuntimeHelpers.GetUninitializedObject` + the parameterless constructor, as Unity does
  (field initializers run, then deserialization overwrites serialized fields). A class without
  one is created with no constructor run at all, its base classes' and field initializers
  included, and nothing is logged (UnityProbe's missingtypes; Trash Cans' components have only
  a constructor taking a state).
- **Costs at ONI's scale.** A late-game colony holds hundreds of thousands of objects, most of
  them scene roots (buildings, items, critters), and creates, destroys and re-parents them
  constantly (an item stored is parented to its storage). Scene roots are therefore an ordered
  slot list (`SceneRoots`: constant-time removal, compaction into a new array, enumeration
  safe against it), and per-frame walks cache what they look up per GameObject against its
  copy-on-write component array (`UiParts` for the canvas walk). Searches by type
  (`FindObjectsByType`) walk the scenes and skip inactive subtrees when inactive objects are not
  asked for.
- **Per-frame allocation.** ONI issues ~1,700 draws a frame (most through `Graphics.DrawMesh`) and
  rebuilds several meshes every frame, so the render path allocates almost nothing per draw:
  draw items, draw lists and canvas batches are reused frame to frame (`FrameRenderer.NewDrawItem`,
  `NewDrawList`; valid until `EndFrame`); queued meshes are values; `DrawMesh` shares the property
  block's sheet with the queued draw until the frame renders, a later change moving the block to a
  copy (`PropertySheet.SharedEpoch`); the device's per-draw inputs come from the recording frame's
  arena (`FrameArena.Next`) with their command delegate made once; mesh uploads hold the mesh's own
  arrays, which are never written once published (`MeshNative`); colours given as bytes stay bytes.
- **Resolved once, not per draw.** Program variants are selected once per material, pass and draw
  keyword list while keywords are unchanged (`MaterialNative.Variants`); what a material and the
  global properties give a program (uniform values, block bytes, sampler textures, pass state) is
  resolved once per their versions (`MaterialValues`), a draw resolving only its per-draw values
  and what its own block overrides; render queues and `_ST` property ids are parsed once.

### 3.3 Player loop

One thread, Unity's order (*usage §1.3, §3.5*), driven by `OniMoono.Host`:

```
Initialization  time update (Time.*), pending scene-load completion
EarlyUpdate     platform events → Input state; Screen size changes
                Start pass
FixedUpdate     0..n steps (accumulator, maximumDeltaTime clamp), each followed by a Start pass;
                coroutines WaitForFixedUpdate; Destroy carried out
Update          Update; Start pass (ScriptRunDelayedDynamicFrameRate); Destroy carried out;
                coroutines (null, WaitForSeconds, custom yields).
PreLateUpdate   Animators (DirectorUpdateAnimationBegin/End); LateUpdate; Start pass; Destroy
                carried out
PostLateUpdate  Canvas.willRenderCanvases (uGUI layout/graphic rebuild) → render all cameras
                → screen-space-overlay canvases → WaitForEndOfFrame coroutines → present
```

Quit (`Application.Quit`, closing the window, or `--frames N` in test runs): a requested quit is
put to `Application.wantsToQuit` at the end of its frame, after WaitForEndOfFrame, each handler in
turn (one that answers false cancels it and the rest are not asked; one that throws is logged and
counts as agreeing); then `OnApplicationQuit` to every active behaviour, `Application.quitting`
(a handler's exception ends it), every scene unloaded (OnDisable/OnDestroy), the graphics device
and window closed,
the log closed, then the process ends with `_exit(code)`: game threads may still be inside
native plugins (SimDLL worldgen), and running the plugins' static destructors under them crashes
or deadlocks. The game registers no `ProcessExit` handlers.

Pending Starts run in the order they were queued, as Unity's delayed-call queue does: a
behaviour is queued when its activation begins, before its Awake (or when it is enabled later),
not by script execution order. Both were measured in the original player: a large save's World
(order 6) starts before Game (order -10), and an object an Awake creates starts after its creator
although it is enabled first. (Loading a save, Game's Awake creates the screens, among them the
new-colony screen; Game starts first and destroys that screen, whose Start would otherwise name
the colony anew and move its saves to a new folder.)

A Start pass runs the Starts queued before it began; those queued meanwhile (objects a Start
creates) wait. FixedUpdate, Update and LateUpdate start a member whose Start is still pending
just before its first call, so it starts ahead of pending behaviours without that message. A
behaviour also takes its place among the update callbacks when its activation begins: a
component that an Awake adds (the game's `MyCmpAdd`) is enabled before its adder but updates
after it. All of this was measured in the original (UnityProbe scenarios 13 to 19). The game
depends on it: SaveLoader loads a save from a Start, so the Duplicants' StandardWorker starts
before their other components and spawns their MinionIdentity before their KPrefabID. A dead
Duplicant thus enters `Components.LiveMinionIdentities` and is removed again once its KPrefabID
restores the Dead tag, and that removal reorders the list.

Destroy is carried out at three points, measured in the original (UnityProbe's destroy phases
and scenario 20): after the fixed steps, after the Start pass that follows Update, and after
LateUpdate's; a call made later in the frame waits for the next frame's Update. The Start pass
comes first, so its Starts still find what Update destroyed, and a pending Start runs on a
descendant that Destroy left enabled before its OnDestroy. Loading a save, Game's Start (just
before its first Update) destroys the new-colony screen, whose CharacterContainers register in
their Start and unregister in OnDestroy.

Coroutines are Unity's state machine: an `IEnumerator` is advanced immediately by
`StartCoroutine`; nested `IEnumerator`/`Coroutine` yields wait for the child;
`CustomYieldInstruction` is re-polled each frame via `keepWaiting` (the shared cached
`WaitForSecondsRealtime` instance must behave exactly as Unity's managed implementation does).

### 3.4 Serialization and assets

**Readers (`OniMoono.Assets`)** parse SerializedFile v22 (big-endian header, little-endian
data), UnityFS bundles (LZMA, LZ4/LZ4HC block and blocks-info compression), `.resS`/`.resource`
streaming, and resolve PPtrs (`fileID` → externals, `pathID`). Built-in files map to
`OxygenNotIncluded_Data/Resources/`.

**Native classes** (GameObject, Transform, Material, Shader, Texture2D, Sprite, SpriteAtlas,
Mesh, TextAsset, Font, Canvas, CanvasRenderer, Camera, RectTransform, VideoClip, AnimationClip,
AnimatorController, ParticleSystem, …) are read with the **Unity 6000.3.5f2 release type
trees** (`cache/typetree/InfoJson_6000.3.5f2.json`, vendored into the repo as a compressed
resource), because player files strip type trees. A generic type-tree walker produces a typed
field view; per-class "binders" copy fields into engine objects. Every object must consume
exactly its byte size; a mismatch is an error, never ignored.

**Script classes (MonoBehaviour / ScriptableObject payloads)** have no type tree. We build the
layout from the **actual managed type** following Unity's serialization rules:
serializable fields are instance fields that are public or `[SerializeField]`, not
`[NonSerialized]`, not static/const/readonly, of a serializable type (primitives, enums by
underlying type, `string`, `UnityEngine.Object` subclasses as PPtr, `[Serializable]`
non-abstract classes/structs (generic allowed), arrays and `List<T>` of these (no nested
collections), and Unity's built-in serializable structs: Vector2/3/4(Int), Quaternion,
Matrix4x4, Color, Color32, Rect(Int), Bounds(Int), LayerMask, AnimationCurve, Gradient,
RectOffset, GUIStyle, Hash128, …); depth limit 10; `[FormerlySerializedAs]` irrelevant for
reading (names come from our layout, the data has none). Alignment follows Unity's rules
(4-byte align after bool/byte/char/short runs, after strings and arrays). The exact-size
check over all ~18.8k MonoBehaviours in the build is the proof that the rules are right.

The layout builder is shared by three users: **file deserialization, `Object.Instantiate`
cloning, and `JsonUtility`**. Cloning is serialization-shaped, not a shallow copy: only
serialized fields are copied; references to objects inside the cloned hierarchy are remapped
to the clones; external references are kept; the serializer has no null, so a null string,
array, list or serializable class is `""`, empty or a new instance in the clone (measured in the
original player; issue #17); `ISerializationCallbackReceiver` hooks run
(`OnBeforeSerialize` on the source, `OnAfterDeserialize` on the clone). Non-serialized fields
of the clone keep their constructor/initializer values.

**Loading model.** Scenes (`level0..2`) are loaded in full on `SceneManager.LoadScene`.
Other files load objects **lazily by PPtr**: an object is materialized the first time it is
referenced, with its dependencies. `Resources.Load` uses the `ResourceManager.m_Container` map;
`AssetBundle.LoadFromFile(Async)` mounts a UnityFS archive as additional files.
`Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets` releases GPU resources of unreferenced loaded assets.

### 3.5 Rendering

**Devices: Vulkan 1.3 by default, OpenGL 4.5 core as the fallback, both via BRUTAL + GLFW.**
Every shader ships as GLSL 150 text produced by Unity's HLSLcc and as SPIR-V for Unity's Vulkan
player, each with per-variant parameter tables (*assets §5*). The OpenGL device runs the GLSL
text and the Vulkan device the SPIR-V (D54): no shader is hand-ported or recompiled, so every
Klei visual effect keeps its exact logic, and the Vulkan device renders the OpenGL device's
pixels. Only mods' shaders without SPIR-V U60 reads are compiled from their GLSL (*Shaders
without U60's Vulkan programs* below).
The renderer option (`--renderer auto|vulkan|opengl`, settings.json's `renderer`, the Moono
Tweaks screen's "Renderer" row; `Renderers.Open`) picks one: auto and vulkan try Vulkan first,
and any failure to start it (no loader, no GPU with dynamic rendering and synchronization2, no
surface or swapchain for the window) releases what was made and opens an OpenGL window
instead. Player.log names the renderer and why (`renderer: Vulkan (auto, default)`,
`renderer: OpenGL (Vulkan unavailable: …)`). Auto also refuses software Vulkan devices (Mesa's
lavapipe: the OpenGL driver is hardware there, under WSLg Mesa's d3d12), the drivers on a short
deny list and a start the guard below recorded as crashed; `--renderer vulkan` takes all of
them.

**Starting** (`VkStartGuard`, `VkDenyList`, as Firefox's DriverCrashGuard and Unreal's
DriverDenyList). Once the GPU is chosen and before its device is made, a line `starting KEY`
goes into `vulkan-start-guard.txt` in the player's cache folder, KEY naming the GPU (vendor and
device ids), the driver's version and Moono's build (the host's informational version). When
the first 60 frames are presented (the first pipelines built and presents done), or the game
ends cleanly before that, the key's lines go. A `starting` line found at the next launch is a
start that never got there (a crash, or a hang the user ended): it becomes `crashed KEY`, and
auto starts that key on OpenGL with the reason in the log, for as long as the GPU, driver and
build stay the same; another one tries Vulkan again. `--renderer vulkan` always tries Vulkan,
and its clean start clears the key. A start that falls back cleanly (Vulkan unavailable) leaves
no line. The guard is not consulted for anything that happens later: a device lost in play, or
presenting that fails for good, quits the game with an error naming Vulkan, Moono Tweaks'
"Renderer" row and `--renderer opengl` and giving the log's path, and the next start tries
Vulkan as before. The deny list, under auto only: Intel's Windows drivers older than 101.5333
(the threshold Unreal's DriverDenyList uses; Intel's Windows `driverVersion` is
`major << 14 | build` of the driver's last two version fields, as vulkan.gpuinfo.org decodes
it), and Mesa's Dozen (Vulkan over Direct3D 12) on any system. GL 4.5 is available on
Linux drivers and on WSLg hardware via Mesa d3d12 (verified: GL 4.6 core on an RTX 3090 with
`GALLIUM_DRIVER=d3d12`).

**Shader runtime (`OniMoono.Graphics`).** From `SerializedShader`: properties, subshaders,
passes, tags, render state (blend/ZTest/ZWrite/Cull/ColorMask/Stencil/Offset — each either a
constant or a reference to a material property, e.g. `[_SrcAlpha]`), keyword space, and the
platform-15 program blobs (LZ4). For each pass, variant selection matches Unity's
(local+global enabled keywords → best matching subprogram). Programs are compiled and linked
on first use and cached by (shader, pass, variant). Uniform binding follows the subprogram's
`SerializedProgramParameters` (vector/matrix params by name and array size, textures by name
→ sampler unit, constant buffers with member offsets, built-in `unity_*`/`hlslcc_mtx4x4*`
matrices). Fixed-function GLSL helpers Unity injects (`#ifdef VERTEX`/`FRAGMENT` sections) are
split exactly as Unity's GL device does.

**Engine renderer (`OniMoono.UnityEngine`, Rendering namespace).** Unity's built-in forward
renderer, restricted to what the game uses (*usage §1*):

- Cameras render in ascending `depth`; per camera: `OnPreCull` → cull (layer mask, Renderer
  enabled/visible) → sort (opaque front-to-back by queue, transparent back-to-front along view
  Z for `TransparencySortMode.Orthographic`, ties in submission order) → command buffers at
  their `CameraEvent`s → draw → `OnRenderImage` chain (component order, temporary RTs) →
  `OnPostRender`.
- Draw sources: `MeshRenderer`+`MeshFilter`, `SpriteRenderer`, `ParticleSystemRenderer`,
  `LineRenderer` (mods' lines: its strip as Unity's BakeMesh measures it, corners mitered; rounded
  corners and caps are drawn square), `CanvasRenderer` (world-space and screen-space-camera canvases), and the per-frame
  `Graphics.DrawMesh` queue (cleared after the frame; `camera` argument restricts it).
- Unity's built-in shader constants are maintained per draw/camera (`unity_ObjectToWorld`,
  `unity_MatrixVP`, `_ProjectionParams`, `_ScreenParams`, `_Time`, `_ZBufferParams`, …) with GL
  clip-space conventions as Unity's GLCore device sets them.
- `RenderTexture` (incl. MRT via `SetTargetBuffers`, temporaries pool, `active`), `Texture2D`
  (CPU copy + `GetRawTextureData<T>` aliasing NativeArray, `Apply`, DXT/BC upload,
  `LoadRawTextureData(IntPtr)`), `Texture2DArray`, `Texture3D`, `Mesh` (dynamic buffers,
  submeshes, topologies), `Material`/`MaterialPropertyBlock`/`Shader` globals, `Graphics.Blit`
  (`Hidden/BlitCopy` from `unity_builtin_extra`), `GL` immediate mode, `CommandBuffer`.
- Gamma colour space (`m_ActiveColorSpace=0`): no sRGB conversions.

**Textures for sampling.** Where the driver has `GL_ARB_bindless_texture` (NVIDIA's, for one),
sampler uniforms are set to resident handles of (texture, sampler object) pairs and draws change
no texture bindings: on NVIDIA's OpenGL driver a draw whose vertex stage reads other textures
than the previous draw's waits for it (the game's animation batches each have their own data
textures; in a large colony that was ~33 of 46 GPU ms per frame, 2.5 with handles). Programs are
compiled with `#extension GL_ARB_bindless_texture` and the default `layout(bindless_sampler)`
qualifier ahead of their uniforms; sampling state then lives in sampler objects, and a texture
whose image is specified again is recreated under a new name (a handle fixes its layout).
Elsewhere (Mesa's d3d12 driver under WSL) textures are bound to units, and so they are on AMD's
Windows driver (`GL_VENDOR` "ATI Technologies Inc."), which lists the extension but charges a flat
~0.25 ms of GPU time per draw and per texture upload with handles resident, against
0.001-0.009 ms bound to units (an RX 9070 XT: 270-570 GPU ms per frame on a loaded colony,
26-30 with units; issue #27). `--no-bindless` binds on any driver. A texture without an
image (zero width or height) is sampled as no texture, (0, 0, 0, 1).

**Render thread, presentation and frame pacing.** Unity's player records rendering on the main
thread and executes it on a render thread (`kGfxThreadingModeClientWorkerJobs` on GLCore), and
presents from there, so GL work and a swap that blocks — vsync, or a display path that reads the
frame back, as Mesa's d3d12 driver does under X11 — overlap the next frame's game work. We do
the same (`GlWorker`): the device's methods run on the main thread and record commands; a GL
thread that owns the rendering context (a hidden window's, shared with the visible one)
executes them. Recording resolves everything a draw reads from engine objects, so the main
thread can change them while the GL thread works: the program variant, the pass state with its
property references, every uniform value (into a per-frame arena), the textures each sampler
gets, and the mesh's layout and submesh range; changed texels and vertex data are copied when
recorded (a non-readable texture hands over its memory, as it keeps no CPU copy). `Present`
hands the frame to the GL thread once the previous frame has been executed, so one frame is in
flight. Work whose result the main thread needs waits for the GL thread: `ReadPixels` and
captures, compiling a program variant the first time it is used, `Shader.WarmupAllShaders`,
diagnostics. A command that throws is logged and the frame goes on, as an exception in a draw
used to unwind only that draw. The GL thread renders into an offscreen back buffer (colour
texture + depth-stencil); at present it fences the frame and hands it to a presenter thread
current on the window's context, which waits for the fence on its own thread (neither context's
GPU queue waits on the other's), blits to the window, fences the copy and swaps with
`QualitySettings.vSyncCount` as the interval. Up to two frames are queued for presentation, as
Unity's default of two queued frames, and three back buffers rotate; the GL thread waits (on the
GPU) for a buffer's copy fence before drawing into it again. Back-buffer reads (`ReadPixels` of the screen,
captures) read the offscreen buffer of the current frame. Pacing follows Unity's desktop
player: with vSync the swap paces frames; otherwise `Application.targetFrameRate` when set;
otherwise none. Without a display (`--headless`, `--batchmode`) frames are paced at
`targetFrameRate` or 60 Hz.

**Presentation on Windows (DXGI).** On Windows both devices present through a Direct3D 11
flip-model swap chain (`DxgiSwapChain`), on by default (Moono Tweaks' "Present through Direct3D
on Windows", settings.json `"dxgi"`, `--dxgi on|off`). The original (Unity 6 on D3D11) presents
through an 8-bit flip-model DXGI swap chain in the default sRGB colour space, so Windows knows
its frames are SDR. OpenGL presents through WGL with no swap chain Windows can see, and a
VkSwapchainKHR is the driver's to implement; NVIDIA's "Vulkan/OpenGL present method" (Auto by
default) may layer either on DXGI, and Auto HDR or RTX HDR can then take the game for HDR content
and push the brightness up (a user's report: fullscreen forced HDR and maximum brightness). The
window is the same in both (a borderless popup the monitor's size, measured); only the
presentation differed. The swap chain: a D3D11 device on the rendering device's adapter (by its
LUID: Vulkan's `VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties`, OpenGL's `EXT_external_objects_win32`, else
`GL_VENDOR`/`GL_RENDERER` against the DXGI adapters' descriptions; the GPU option's choice is the
device's), `R8G8B8A8_UNORM`, `FLIP_DISCARD`, two buffers, the default colour space
(`RGB_FULL_G22_NONE_P709`), `DXGI_SCALING_STRETCH`, a frame-latency waitable object at a maximum
latency of 2, and `ALLOW_TEARING` when the system supports it, used only without vsync. Each
device renders the picture into one D3D11 texture of its own, made anew (a quarter larger) only
when the window outgrows it, which `CopySubresourceRegion` copies into the back buffer before
`Present` at `QualitySettings.vSyncCount` (0 to 4); with vsync the presenter then waits on the
waitable object until the picture before it retires, two pictures in flight as Unity's default
of two queued frames (with one, Vulkan on the AMD iGPU lost 7% of its frames at 60 Hz: 55.2 fps
against 59.9 on its swapchain; with two, 59.5). Without vsync it does not wait, as the swapchain
paths do not: retiring a picture can take a frame or two (29 ms
a picture measured on the AMD iGPU, whose picture is copied to a monitor on the NVIDIA card),
which would cap the frame rate; the interop lock or keyed mutex bounds what is in flight.
- *OpenGL* (`DxgiTarget`): the texture is registered with GL once through `WGL_NV_DX_interop2`
  for reading and writing (the splash blends) and locked while the presenter's blit fills it,
  flipped (Direct3D's rows run top-down; the splash is drawn flipped too). The swap chain's own
  buffers are never registered with GL (re-registering them after a resize is suspected of a
  use-after-free in NVIDIA's driver, Godot PR #94503).
- *Vulkan* (`VkDxgiTarget`): the texture has an NT handle and a keyed mutex and is imported as a
  Vulkan image (`VK_KHR_external_memory_win32`, a dedicated allocation). The presenter's
  submission takes it from queue family EXTERNAL, blits the frame in (both APIs store the top
  row first: no flip), draws the splash, gives it back in `GENERAL` layout and, through
  `VK_KHR_win32_keyed_mutex`, acquires the mutex with key 0 and releases it with key 1; D3D11
  acquires key 1, copies, releases key 0 and presents. The mutex orders the two APIs' GPU work
  both ways with no CPU wait between them. No VkSwapchainKHR is made while DXGI presents.

A size change calls `ResizeBuffers` before the next picture; between the window's resize and that
picture DXGI stretches the last one. A minimized window keeps its framebuffer size (§3.6), so the
buffers keep theirs; an occluded `Present` (`DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED`) shows nothing and is not
waited for. Exclusive fullscreen stays the window's (GLFW sets the display mode, a monitor-sized
window), not DXGI's `SetFullscreenState`; DXGI is told to leave the window alone
(`DXGI_MWA_NO_WINDOW_CHANGES | NO_ALT_ENTER`). After start-up every DXGI, D3D11 and interop object
is used and released on the presenter thread alone, so neither `Present` nor `ResizeBuffers`
sends the window a message the main thread (which may be waiting on the device thread, which may
be waiting on the presenter) would have to answer. Start-up makes everything that can fail
(the interop extension, the adapter, the D3D11 device, the registration or import, the first
lock) before it gives the window a swap chain, and a failure there leaves the device's own
presentation in use, with one `present:` log line saying why. Once the window has a swap chain,
a failure (the chain's own set-up at start-up; while running a lost device:
`DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED`/`RESET`/`HUNG`, a failed lock, a keyed-mutex timeout, a failed image
view, resize or present) releases everything DXGI held and starts it anew. Vulkan calls
`vkQueueSubmit2` itself for the DXGI submission, under the lock Brutal's `Queue` takes, to see
`VK_TIMEOUT` from the keyed mutex (Brutal's `Submit2` returns nothing then), which would otherwise
leave the presenter waiting on a fence that never signals; a Brutal without that lock (its private
`_lock` field) leaves DXGI off for Vulkan, with the reason on the `present:` line, and Vulkan's
swapchain presents. Restarts come in bursts of ten tries,
1, 2, 4 then 8 s apart (about a minute, outlasting a slow driver reset); a restart that presents
for 60 s ends its burst, so a later failure gets ten tries again. Until a restart succeeds the
device's own presentation stands in: Vulkan's swapchain reaches the screen then (measured), but
OpenGL's SwapBuffers does not on a window whose flip-model swap chain has presented (measured:
the window kept DXGI's last picture while frames went on), so on OpenGL a DXGI that cannot
restart leaves the window still. The
`present:` line at start-up names the adapter and the swap chain's settings; `--dxgi-fault STEP`
makes up a failure at one step, for testing the ways back; with `--frame-stats` the frame counts
include the presenter's time per picture and, every 600 frames, the process's video memory on the
adapter as DXGI counts it. Captures and `ReadPixels` read the offscreen back buffers, never the
window, so they are the same either way.

Measured on Windows 11 with an RTX 3090 and an AMD iGPU (U60 761015, 2026-10-30; the monitor
captured through Desktop Duplication): a paused colony on screen differs from the original's by
0.10% of pixels with Vulkan through DXGI and through its swapchain alike, 0.29% and 0.31% with
OpenGL; DXGI's picture and the device's own differ less than two runs of one path do. The
presenter is busy 0.3 to 0.6 ms a picture through DXGI against 0.1 to 0.2 on the device's own
path. A light colony without vsync ran at 115 fps through DXGI against 111 with Vulkan on the RTX
3090, 59 against 60 on the iGPU, and 159 against 102 with OpenGL; with vsync all held 60 Hz
(two pictures in flight, above); start-up differed by less than the spread between launches. 300
resizes, 300 minimize/restore cycles and 300 mode switches (30 exclusive) on Vulkan, and 150 each
on the iGPU and on OpenGL, showed no failure and no growth in video memory. Every
`--dxgi-fault` step on both devices (start-up before and after the swap chain, a lost device, a
keyed-mutex timeout, a failed image view of a grown texture, ten failed restarts) ended with the
window still showing new frames. Minimized with the game's vsync (a paused colony) the original
stayed at or under 60 fps and every path here at 60 (Vulkan's own swapchain path by pacing its
pictures, VkPresenter). On a 530-nit HDR
monitor, fullscreen at the menu (tools/HdrCheck): with Windows' HDR on (SDR white at 240 nits)
the original, Vulkan through DXGI and through its swapchain, and OpenGL through DXGI all left the
monitor in HDR and reached at most 240 nits, composited as SDR, with no Auto HDR boost; OpenGL
through WGL switched the monitor out of HDR to SDR while fullscreen, a display mode change the
original does not make. With HDR off all five stayed SDR at 80 nits, and Desktop Duplication
(which OBS's display capture uses) lost OpenGL through WGL (`DXGI_ERROR_ACCESS_LOST`) but captured
OpenGL through DXGI. Not measured: Intel GPUs,
Vulkan's validation layer (not installed), input latency.

**Loading splash (`--splash moo`, on by default; `--splash none` or Moono Tweaks turns it off).** The player's own presentation, not the
game's: the presenter thread draws Gassy Moo comets (the game's `meteor_gassymoo` kanim, its
`fall_loop`, read from `sharedassets0.assets` on a worker thread at start-up) over whatever the
window last showed, redrawing about 60 times a second while no game frame comes, so the window
keeps moving while the main and GL threads load. Game frames are not changed: the comets are
drawn into the window after a frame is copied there. Once 30 frames in a row arrive within
100 ms of each other (the main menu), the rain fades out for good. A thin bar under it shows how
far start-up is (`StartupProgress`): it passes checkpoints, the engine's own (window, first scene,
first frame, each content bundle, the asset unload, the menu) and the game's, recognized from its
log lines (Steam ready, `Global`'s start, the mod system, localization). The checkpoint times of
each launch are kept in the player's cache folder. Between two checkpoints the bar eases towards
the next at the last launch's pace (about 80% of the way by the expected time, then creeping on,
never reaching it before it is passed), and while the first scene loads it moves by the objects
loaded; the drawn bar follows that with a 0.25 s smoothing, so it never stalls or jumps.

**Window messages during long frames.** The frame polls the window's messages at its start, as
Unity does, but a start-up frame takes seconds, and Windows marks a window that has not taken its
messages for 5 s as not responding. Long engine steps (loading an object, instantiating, adding a
component, a log line, recording uploads, waiting for a bundle's decode) therefore pump them at
most every 100 ms on the main thread (`MainThreadPump`, `ONI_PUMP_EVENTS=0` turns it off).
Nothing a pump receives reaches the engine or the game within the frame: GLFW's callbacks (keys,
characters, mouse buttons, movement, scroll, cursor entering, close, framebuffer size, window
position, monitors) are kept in order and replayed at the start of the next frame's poll, just
before the messages that came since, so input state, `Event`s, `Screen` sizes and focus change
only at frame start, as before. The pump calls no game code, and no engine code but GLFW's own.
Native work inside game code (FMOD loading its banks) cannot be interrupted: those stretches stay
unpumped.

Textures loaded from asset files are uploaded as part of loading, as in Unity, not on first
draw: first draws of screens with many textures (the research tree) would otherwise hitch for a
second and throw off the game's time-based UI animation. A non-readable texture loaded on the main
thread is handed to the background uploads (`GlBackgroundUploads`) as it loads: worker threads
read its texels from the asset file, and the GL thread uploads one texture at a time whenever it
has no frame to execute, in load order, with a fence keeping the GPU no more than 32 MiB behind.
A frame therefore waits at most for one texture's upload, and loading goes on meanwhile (the first
scene's 2 GiB of animation textures go up while the game starts up; a DLC bundle's while the next
bundles load). A draw that samples a texture still queued takes it back and records its upload
into the frame ahead of the draw, as every upload was recorded before; so does a change to the
texture, and a release drops it. The texture gives up its texels when queued (a non-readable
texture keeps no CPU copy once uploaded, and the game cannot read it). Readable textures, and
textures loaded on other threads, are uploaded by the main thread before the next frame renders;
when many are pending at once their texels are read on worker threads first and the uploads go
to the GL thread in batches. `ONI_BACKGROUND_UPLOADS=0` turns the background uploads off.

Per-draw uniform blocks are streamed through a ring buffer that stays persistently mapped for the
device's lifetime (`GlStreamBuffer`, ARB_buffer_storage): data is copied into the mapping, blocks
are bound by range, and a fence per frame keeps a region from being reused before the GPU has
consumed it; the storage is never respecified (no orphaning). Texture content updates into
storage of unchanged size and format (`Apply` on the game's per-frame property textures) use
`glTexSubImage2D` from client memory. Routing them through a pixel-unpack buffer (orphaned or
persistently mapped) halved their cost but corrupted textures on Mesa's d3d12 driver in long runs
(white sprite-atlas pages, world-sized garbage triangles, device removal), so it is not used.

**The Vulkan device (`OniMoono.Desktop.Vulkan`).** Its main-thread side is the OpenGL device's:
`GlDrawRecorder` records each draw (variant, resolved pass state, uniform values, textures,
mesh), `GlTextures.Prepare` and `GlMeshes.Prepare` copy changed data, and `GlWorker` hands
frames to a device thread; only the work posted for resources differs (`IResourceWork`).

- *Programs* (`VulkanProgram`, `SmolV`, `VkPrograms`, `SpirvReflection`). A Vulkan variant is
  one entry of the shader's platform-18 blob holding every stage as SMOL-V-compressed SPIR-V
  (decoded with a port of smol-v's decoder; each decoded size is checked against its header,
  and `tools/ShaderSurvey vulkan` runs all 539 of U60's programs through SPIRV-Tools' validator)
  and a table mapping mesh channels to vertex input locations. Its parameter table gives each
  constant buffer, texture and sampler a binding as `stages << 24 | set << 16 | binding`:
  textures, their separate samplers and storage buffers in set 0, constant buffers in set 1.
  `GlUniforms` writes each draw's values into the programs' constant buffers at the table's
  offsets (matrices as four 16-byte columns, arrays at a 16-byte stride: the GLCore programs'
  layout), and `GlDrawRecorder` resolves textures and selects variants as for OpenGL, from the
  pass's Vulkan variants. Variants this device does not draw, each logged once per shader:
  shadow-comparison and multisample textures (shadow and frame-debugger variants), XR stereo
  (multiview) variants and stages other than vertex and fragment; none is used by the game.
  A variant that cannot be built (damaged data, a module or pipeline the driver refuses) is
  logged once per shader and kept as a program that draws nothing, so no exception reaches the
  game each frame; one that ran out of memory is logged and tried again at its next draw.
- *Shaders without U60's Vulkan programs.* Mods' AssetBundles built with other Unity versions
  carry Vulkan programs in another entry layout, or none (docs/research/mod-bundle-shaders.md:
  13 of the 34 mods with shaders). The route is chosen once per shader and logged
  (`VkPrograms.PlatformOf`): Unity's Vulkan programs when every pass with programs has Vulkan
  variants whose first one reads as a U60 entry; else, with GLCore programs, those compiled to
  SPIR-V at run time (`VkGlsl`, `VkShaderCompiler`, shaderc, as an OpenGL driver compiles the
  same text); else the shader is not drawn, as on OpenGL. The rewrite lays a program out as
  Unity's Vulkan programs are (loose uniforms in one std140 block per stage and named blocks in
  set 1, samplers and storage buffers in set 0, by name and the same in both stages; inputs at
  their channels' locations; varyings one location map by name) and ends the vertex stage as
  Unity's do, negating `gl_Position.y`; the device gives these programs the same projection, so
  they render alike and share targets, depth and pipelines with the shipped ones. Code the
  GLCore compile fixed for OpenGL (`UNITY_REVERSED_Z` and `UNITY_UV_STARTS_AT_TOP` branches,
  `gl_FragCoord`'s origin) keeps OpenGL's meaning; the mods' shaders met (TextMeshPro, particles,
  tiles) use none of it. `ONI_VULKAN_ROUTE=glcore` sends every shader this way (a diagnostic):
  against OpenGL's references the menus, options, new game, research, burst and intro
  scenarios match, while Klei's world comes out black (not pinned down; most likely its GLCore
  programs' OpenGL depth and render-texture conventions); Klei's shaders always take the
  shipped route.
- *Conventions.* Unity's Vulkan programs are compiled with reversed Z and UVs starting at the
  top, as Unity's manual ("Platform-specific rendering differences") describes; the rest was
  read from the SPIR-V. Each vertex stage ends by negating `gl_Position.y`, so with the camera's
  projection the back buffer is stored top row first, as the window shows it, and the presenter
  copies it unflipped. Into a render texture the projection's y is negated as well
  (`_ProjectionParams.x` -1), which leaves render textures' rows in OpenGL's order, so sampling
  them reads what OpenGL's do. The projection the programs read (`UNITY_MATRIX_P` and the
  products with it; `RenderConventions`) maps depth to [1, 0], near to far, `_ZBufferParams`
  takes the reversed form, and `unity_CameraProjection` keeps the camera's own matrix. Depth
  tests compare the other way (Less and Greater, LessEqual and GreaterEqual swapped), depth
  offsets are negated, clears write 1 - the value asked for, and new depth surfaces start at
  0. Viewport and scissor rectangles keep OpenGL's bottom-left origin: unchanged in a render
  texture, turned over in the back buffer, as are `ReadPixels` of the screen. Unity's front faces
  are clockwise on screen, which Vulkan calls clockwise in the back buffer and counter-clockwise
  in a flipped render texture. Absent mesh channels read OpenGL's constant attributes (white
  colour, position (0, 0, 0, 1), zero otherwise) from a stride-0 buffer. The OpenGL device keeps
  its own conventions; the game sees a Vulkan device (D54).
- *Execution.* A target is a dynamic-rendering pass, begun by its first draw or clear (a clear
  with nothing drawn yet is the pass's load op) and ended when the target changes, a copy must
  run outside it, or the frame ends. Pipelines are made on first use per program, resolved pass
  state, vertex layout, topology and target formats, with the driver's pipeline cache kept in the
  player's cache folder. Set 0 is pushed (`VK_KHR_push_descriptor`, when the program's bindings
  fit the device's push limit) or allocated from per-frame pools. A draw's constant buffers are
  written together to the frame's uniform stream (4 MB chunks kept for the device's life) and
  bound by dynamic offsets into a set 1 made once per program and chunk. Staging copies and
  immediate geometry go through a host-visible stream per frame, in 8 MB chunks: the first two
  of each frame slot are kept, the others released once unused for eight frames, so a save's
  burst of uploads does not stay resident. Memory comes from VMA. Each image tracks its layout
  and last access, and each use makes the barrier it needs (a render target's colour writes
  before it is sampled; transfers before and after copies). A pipeline the driver refuses is
  logged once per program and remembered, so draws with that state are left out without
  trying again (out of memory is not remembered: the next draw tries again); a command that
  throws ends the open pass and is logged once per kind. A texture's new storage is made before the
  old one is retired, so a failed allocation leaves the texture as it was; a mesh whose new
  buffer cannot be made draws nothing until its next upload (its submeshes' ranges are the new
  ones), its old buffer retired rather than destroyed under recorded draws.
- *Frames and uploads.* Two frames are in flight, each with its command pool, fence, stream,
  descriptor pools and the resources released while it was recorded (destroyed once its fence
  has signalled). A frame is submitted in batches (at present, and when the main thread needs a
  result: `ReadPixels`, which then waits for the queue). Each batch has an upload command buffer
  submitted ahead of its rendering: a texture the batch has not used yet is updated there, as are
  new render surfaces (cleared, as OpenGL's device clears them) and staged mesh copies; a texture
  the batch already sampled is updated at its place in the rendering, ending the pass. A mesh
  gets a new buffer on every upload, so draws recorded before a change read their own data
  without waiting. Re-uploads into unchanged storage send only the changed rows, as on OpenGL.
- *Presentation.* `VkPresenter` keeps `GlPresenter`'s design: three offscreen back buffers, at
  most two frames queued (one with vsync), the last frame shown again when one drew nothing or
  the window's contents were damaged, the splash drawn over the window on the presenter thread
  (`SplashRain`, shared with `GlSplash`), and a minimized window keeping its size (issue #29)
  while nothing is presented to its 0x0 surface. Both threads submit to the one graphics queue
  in order (a frame before the copy that reads it), so no semaphores pass between them; the
  presenter leaves the back buffer as a colour attachment. The swapchain is made again when the
  surface's size or the present mode changes or it reports itself out of date; vsync uses FIFO,
  no vsync IMMEDIATE (else MAILBOX). `vSyncCount` 2 to 4 presents each frame that many times
  under FIFO, an image per vertical blank, so the game runs at a half (or a third, a quarter)
  of the refresh rate as OpenGL's swap interval makes it. A swapchain that cannot be made (out
  of memory during a resize) is tried again after 0.1 s, the delay doubling up to 2 s, with no
  frames shown meanwhile; presenting is given up only after five failures in a row spanning
  ten seconds. The old swapchain is destroyed either way. The swapchain format is B8G8R8A8 or
  R8G8B8A8 UNORM in sRGB non-linear colour space, written as OpenGL's default framebuffer is (no
  sRGB encoding). On Windows, DXGI presents instead when it starts (*Presentation on Windows*
  above).
- *Device loss.* At start-up any failure falls back to OpenGL (*Starting* above). A device
  lost in play cannot be recovered in place (every texture, mesh and program would have to be
  made again, and the non-readable textures have no CPU copy), nor switched to OpenGL, which
  would need the same: the device thread stops recording, the log names the loss, and the game
  quits with an error saying Vulkan stopped working, that OpenGL can be chosen under Renderer in
  Moono Tweaks or with `--renderer opengl` if it keeps happening, and where the log is.
  Presenting that fails for good (a lost surface, a swapchain still not made after its
  retries, a swapchain format that takes no copies) quits the same way rather than running on
  with a black window. Neither leaves a mark for the next start.
  `ONI_VULKAN_FAIL` takes a comma-separated list of faults for tests (`VkFault`): `context`,
  `device`, `presenter` and `presenter-create` fail start-up at that step; `present-after:N`
  fails presenting at frame N and `present-oom-after:N` makes three swapchain creations run
  out of memory from frame N; `alloc-every:N`, `pipeline-every:N` and `program-every:N` make
  every Nth texture or mesh allocation, pipeline or program build run out of memory;
  `crash-at:N` ends the process at presented frame N as a crash would, and `guard-build:X`
  keys the start-up guard to build X.
- *Diagnostics.* `--vulkan-validation` (or `ONI_VULKAN_VALIDATION=1`) enables the Khronos
  validation layer when installed, its messages in the log; `--frame-stats` counts draws,
  pipeline binds, render passes, passes ended by uploads and submits; GPU frame time comes from
  timestamp queries. `--check-shaders` on Vulkan builds every variant and a pipeline for its
  pass's state, and counts what fails.

On Windows the Vulkan swapchain is what the paused DXGI presenter (a D3D11 flip-model swapchain
fed by the GL frame, for correct HDR and flip-model handling) aimed at: a modern, compositor-
friendly presentation path. With Vulkan the default, that presenter would only matter for the
OpenGL fallback.

**UI rendering.** `Canvas` implements Unity's canvas batching: per root canvas, walk
`CanvasRenderer`s in hierarchy order, apply `CanvasGroup` alpha, `RectMask2D` clip rects
(`_ClipRect` + `UNITY_UI_CLIP_RECT`) and stencil masks (materials from uGUI's own
`StencilMaterial`), and draw in order (no reordering across materials; Unity's batch
merging is an optimisation we may add only where it cannot change the result).

### 3.6 Platform

`OniMoono.Platform` wraps `Brutal.Glfw`: one window, with a GL 4.5 core context or for a Vulkan
surface (made again for OpenGL when Vulkan cannot start on it), vsync,
resize, fullscreen/windowed modes (`Screen.*`), monitors/resolutions, DPI, keyboard
(GLFW key → Unity `KeyCode`; character keys through the active layout, as the game's Input
Manager has "Use Physical Keys" off: `KeyboardLayout`, measured on AZERTY), text input (UTF-32 via our own char-callback handling where
BRUTAL's 16-bit truncation would corrupt input), mouse buttons/position (bottom-left origin)
and scroll, hardware cursors from `Texture2D`, clipboard, focus events. Legacy Input Manager
axes/buttons come from `globalgamemanagers` `InputManager` settings, with Unity's gravity /
sensitivity / dead-zone smoothing.

On X11 a hardware cursor keeps its texture's size, as in Unity's Linux player: with Klei's 32x32
`cursor_arrow`, XFixes read the shown cursor in both players as 32x32 with its hotspot at (2, 2),
the same pixels, with `XCURSOR_SIZE` unset, 48 or 64 and with `Xcursor.size: 48` in the display's
resources (on Xvfb). On Windows `Win32Cursor` scales it with the pointer size, as the original
does (issue #18); Wayland compositors are unmeasured.

On Windows the window takes IME input only when `Input.imeCompositionMode` asks for it
(`ImeInput`): `On`, which a focused TextMeshPro or uGUI field sets, or `Auto` with an IMGUI text
field focused. Otherwise its input context is taken away, so an IME such as Microsoft Pinyin
leaves the game's hotkeys alone (issue #30). Measured in the original with the Chinese layout on
its window and UnityPlayer.dll's imm32 calls logged: `ImmAssociateContext(hwnd, NULL)` outside
text fields, `ImmAssociateContextEx(hwnd, NULL, IACE_DEFAULT)` in one, applied at the window's
next focus, layout or key message; ours applies the mode at the next frame's event poll.
Committed IME text arrives as typed characters; ours reports no composition string (the
original's TMP fields show the composition inline, ours leave it to the IME's own window), and
X11 input methods are untouched (none was available to measure).

A minimized window keeps the size it had, as in Unity's player: Windows reports its framebuffer
as 0x0, but `Screen.width`/`height`, `Display.renderingWidth`/`Height` and the cameras' pixel
sizes stay what they were, and frames go on rendering at that size until the window is restored
(measured in the original, windowed and fullscreen; issue #29, where the game's
`LightBufferCompositor` asked for a temporary of `Screen.width / 8` pixels).

### 3.7 Text and fonts

TMP runs as shipped. The engine provides what it needs: `Font`, `TextCore` data types,
`FontEngine` used only for dynamic atlases, and `TextGenerator` for the legacy `UI.Text`
(debug/mod screens).

- **FreeType** is BRUTAL's build (`Ahwoo.BRUTAL.FreeType`: `libfreetype.so` / `freetype.dll`)
  through our own P/Invokes (Unity links FreeType statically; the game ships none); its records'
  C `long` fields are `CLong`, 64-bit on Linux and 32-bit on Windows. OpenType layout data FreeType does not expose (GPOS
  `kern`/`mark`/`mkmk`, GSUB `liga`, GDEF classes, legacy `kern`, OS/2) is read from the sfnt
  tables in managed code.
- **Atlases**: Unity's MaxRects packer over TMP's free/used rect lists (glyph + padding on each
  side); SDF modes rasterize the outline (×8/16/32 supersampled for `SDF8/16/32`) and run
  Gustavson's anti-aliased EDT; the field is 0.5 on the outline with spread = padding + 1
  (TMP's `_GradientScale`), measured against the game's own SDF atlases.
- **Legacy fonts** (class 128) render glyphs on demand into the font's own `Font Texture`
  (Alpha8, from 256², packed on a skyline, grown when a rebuild with the current frame's glyphs
  still overflows) and raise `Font.textureRebuilt` on rebuilds. Glyphs come from a chain of
  faces, each glyph from the first face that has it (`FontNative.Chain`, docs/cleanroom/ugui.md
  "Legacy Text glyph placement"): a font's own data, else (the built-in `LegacyRuntime`, fonts
  from `CreateDynamicFontFromOSFont`) the first installed OS font of `m_FontNames`, then on
  Linux FreeSans, DejaVu Sans and Liberation Sans, as measured; with real bold and italic
  faces. Off Linux (unmeasured) the last link is the built-in Liberation Sans from the game's
  own font asset, which the TextCore font engine also loads for data-less fonts. Glyphs are
  rendered unhinted at whole-pixel sizes, with whole-pixel advances and a one-pixel padded
  box; the generator rounds line metrics, line starts and the block's top to whole pixels, and
  kerns by the font's serialized `m_KerningValues`.
  `Resources.GetBuiltinResource<Font>("Arial.ttf")`, the font's name before Unity renamed it
  (LegacyRuntime's `m_FontNames` is still `["Arial"]`), gives LegacyRuntime: it is the only font
  in `unity default resources`, and the original gives mods that ask for Arial (the only built-in
  name the Workshop builds in `out/ws` ask for) a font without an error. A dynamic font is laid
  out at the text's size times the canvas scale, rounded down to whole pixels (measured in the
  original: a 10-point Text on the game's 0.86 canvas is as wide as at 8 pixels).

### 3.8 Audio, video, other modules

- Audio: FMOD through the game's own `FMODUnity` + native `libfmodstudio.so`; the engine
  supplies what FMODUnity needs (paths, Transform, components, Timeline/Playables types).
- Video: `VideoPlayer` decodes VP8 WebM from `resources.resource` with our own EBML demuxer and
  our own VP8 decoder (`Video/Engine/Vp8`, a port of RFC 6386's reference decoder; VP8 decoding is
  exact by specification, and every frame of the game's 18 clips decodes to the same planes as
  libvpx, which the tests use as reference) on a decode thread per player, so no codec library
  is needed on either platform. Frames are converted to RGBA on the CPU with the exact formula of the build's own
  `Hidden/VideoDecode` shader (BT.601 limited range, bilinear chroma) into a CPU `Texture2D`
  that the device uploads; a GPU path running that shader on the planes can replace the
  converter. The game's clips have no audio tracks (and the game sets `audioOutputMode = None`);
  video audio is not played.
- `Animator`: AnimatorController state machine + AnimationClip curve evaluation for the
  properties the game animates (UI). `ParticleSystem`: the modules the prefabs actually enable,
  and for systems mods build by script `Emit(EmitParams, count)`, the velocity limit and z
  rotation over lifetime, as measured (`tools/UnityProbe`, `particleemit`). Features no game data
  uses (in mods' bundles: clamp velocity, rotation, collision, lights, sub emitters, other shapes
  and texture-sheet or trail variants…) are not simulated; the system loads without each and logs
  it once (`[engine] particles: … is not simulated`).
- `UnityWebRequest` → `HttpClient`; `ImageConversion` → stb_image / stb_image_write
  (`Ahwoo.BRUTAL.Stb`); `JsonUtility` → the shared layout builder; `Physics.Raycast` → the
  colliders present in data; IMGUI → clipboard and the event/GUI surface the code paths touch.
- 2D physics is not simulated: no step moves a `Rigidbody2D` and no contact or trigger message
  (`OnTriggerEnter2D`…) is sent. The game creates no 2D bodies; for mods that do, the bodies'
  and colliders' settings are kept as given (`bodyType`, `mass`, `gravityScale`, the dampings,
  `isTrigger`, `CircleCollider2D.radius`, `Physics2D.IgnoreLayerCollision`'s matrix…), so their
  prefabs build (Twitch Integration's glitter pufts, Chaos Events for Twitch Integration's Omega
  Sawblade). `Rigidbody2D.AddForce`, which only a step could honour, is not implemented: Chaos
  Events' sawblade fails with MissingMethodException once its event homes in. Unity's internal
  binding attributes (`UnityEngine.Bindings.NativeHeaderAttribute` and the like, in
  `SharedInternalsModule` and `CoreModule`) exist with Unity's constructors, so a mod that merges
  copies of Unity's modules into its own assembly (Twitch Integration carries
  `InputLegacyModule` and `TextRenderingModule`) has its types' attributes resolve; before, the
  first one stopped Harmony's `PatchAll` (TypeLoadException) and KMod disabled the mod.

## 4. Threading

The game relies on release-player leniency (*runtime §6*): worker, path-prober, worldgen,
HTTP and FMOD threads call into the engine. Our rules:

1. **Free-threaded:** math/value types; `Application` path and platform getters (immutable
   after startup); `Object ==`/`!=`/`bool`/`name`/`GetInstanceID`; `Component.transform` /
   `gameObject`; `GetComponent(s)`; `Transform.position` and other transform **reads**;
   `TextAsset.text`/`bytes`; `Resources.Load` (loading is serialized by a lock and completes
   on the calling thread, as the game's lazy `Db.Get` needs); `Debug.Log*`.
2. **`Debug.Log*` from other threads** invokes `logMessageReceivedThreaded` alone, on the
   caller, and never `logMessageReceived`, later or queued (measured with UnityProbe's
   `logthreads` scenario in the original, for a `Thread`, a thread-pool item and a `Task`; so
   too for an exception nothing catches on a thread, which D16 logs there). A message logged on
   the main thread invokes `logMessageReceived` and then `logMessageReceivedThreaded`, at once.
   The callbacks run before the text is written; a handler's exception ends the call (the
   handlers after it, and after a `logMessageReceived` handler's the threaded event too) and is
   written as a logged exception's text, ahead of the message's, reaching no callback; a message
   logged inside a handler is written and reaches no callback. KCrashReporter listens on
   `logMessageReceived`, so worldgen's errors on its threads open no error dialog.
3. **Main thread only** (asserted in all builds, the failure is an exception with a clear
   message, as Unity's "can only be called from the main thread"): structural mutation
   (`Instantiate`, `AddComponent`, `Destroy`, `SetParent`, transform setters, activation),
   rendering and GPU resource APIs, scene loading.
4. Worker-thread writes into `GetRawTextureData` arrays are allowed (plain CPU memory until
   `Apply`). GL calls happen only on the GL thread, apart from the presenter thread's copy
   and swap on the window's own context (§3.5); the device records them on the main thread.
5. Reverse P/Invoke: SimDLL's error callback is created by game code per call; exceptions
   crossing it are fatal on CoreCLR, which matches Unity's crash behaviour on that path.

## 5. Numerics

`Vector2/3/4`, `Quaternion`, `Matrix4x4`, `Color`, `Mathf`, … are implemented with Unity's
formulas (including `Mathf.Approximately`, `RoundToInt` banker's rounding, `Random.Range`
inclusive/exclusive rules, `Quaternion.Euler` order ZXY). Results follow the original bit for
bit where that was measured and matters (D25 lists them); elsewhere the aim is algorithmic
equivalence. The runtime's float rounding differs from Unity's Mono (D25) and so does its number
formatting (D2).

## 6. Configuration and paths

`Application.dataPath` = `<game>/OxygenNotIncluded_Data`, `streamingAssetsPath` =
`<dataPath>/StreamingAssets`, `isEditor` = false, `isPlaying` = true. On Linux,
`persistentDataPath` = `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included` (Unity's Linux rule:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/unity3d/<company>/<product>`) and `platform` = `LinuxPlayer`. On Windows the
player is the Windows one: `platform` = `WindowsPlayer`, `persistentDataPath` =
`%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/<company>/<product>` (the LocalLow known folder),
`temporaryCachePath` under `%TEMP%`, all paths with forward slashes as Unity reports them; the
game itself keeps saves, mods and its settings under `Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded`
(`Environment.GetFolderPath`). The Windows build is the same game build as the Linux one
(ChangeList 744825) and its shaders carry OpenGL programs next to the Direct3D ones, so the same
device runs its data. Natives resolve per platform (`Plugins/x86_64/<name>.dll` on Windows,
`Plugins/lib<name>.so` on Linux, and for the macOS bundle the executable of
`Contents/PlugIns/<name>.bundle`: `GameLayout`, which tells the layout from the install's files;
macOS is groundwork only, `docs/research/metal-backend-design.md`); Steamworks.NET is built per runtime identifier (library name
and callback packing differ); FreeType comes from BRUTAL's package on both. Company/product/version
come from `globalgamemanagers` PlayerSettings. The host takes `--game <dir>` (default
`~/projects/oni-linux`), `--headless` (no window, no GL: logic-only frames for tests),
`--frames N`, `--capture FRAME:PATH` (§7), and `--log <file>`.

The host directory carries a `Restarter` (`Restarter.exe` on Windows, a .NET program), as Klei's
player directory does: `App.Restart` (language change) starts it with the player's executable
path and quits. Ours waits for the player to exit and starts it again with the arguments it was
started with (recorded by the host in `ONI_MOONO_RESTART_ARGS`, shell-quoted, and
`ONI_MOONO_RESTART_ARGV`, JSON, with `ONI_MOONO_RESTART_PID`).

**Player options (Moono Tweaks).** The game tweaks (`GameTweakNames`), the loading splash, frame
stats and the log's paths come from three places, later ones winning: built-in defaults (every tweak
but `ChangingBehaviour`'s, as `--game-tweak exact`; the moo splash; no frame stats; personal paths
hidden in the log), the settings file `<persistentDataPath>/oni-moono/settings.json`
(`PlayerSettings`: only the choices that differ from the defaults, so a default changed by an update
reaches everyone who has not chosen otherwise; a run home has its own), and the command line
(`EffectiveOptions`). A command line with any `--game-tweak` value sets the whole set of tweaks for
the run (`exact`, `all`, `none`, names, `-NAME`), `--splash moo|none` the splash, `--frame-stats`
the frame stats, `--log-paths hidden|full` the log's paths. They are read before the log opens,
which needs the last; the start of the log names the file and each option with where it came from.
The main menu's **Moono Tweaks** button, directly below Mods, opens a screen
(`src/OniMoono.GameTweaks/MoonoTweaksMenu.cs`) made of the game's own UI: the Mods screen's prefab
instantiated inactive, its `ModsScreen` swapped for `MoonoTweaksScreen` before it wakes, and the
menu's button prefab and style for the button. It lists every option from that list with a toggle
and a line on what it does, the tweaks that change gameplay labelled so, and rows the command line
set dimmed and fixed; "Restart to apply" writes the file and restarts through `App.Restart` (the
Restarter above), and the restarted player reads it with the same command line. `--no-tweaks-menu`
leaves the button out, as in the original's menu (e2e runs compared with it). Test runs pin the
options: `scripts/run.sh` and `scripts/run-windows.sh` pass `--game-tweak none --splash none
--log-paths full` first, so a run has exactly the tweaks, splash and log paths its own arguments
name (`--log-paths full`: the test tools read the run home's paths in log lines).

Test runs (not the product): `--run-home DIR` keeps a run's per-user data under DIR (Unity's
paths, and on Windows the Documents and local application data folders the game asks .NET for),
`--audio-wav DIR` sends the game's audio to `DIR/fmodoutput.wav` (FMOD's WAV writer) instead of
the sound device, and the offline Steam double (`tools/SteamStub`, an ELF library or a PE DLL
written directly) stands in for the Steam client. `scripts/run-windows.sh` uses all three.

## 7. Logging and diagnostics

`Debug.Log*` and the logger/handler surface behave as Unity's (the game replaces the handler).
Our engine logs through `Brutal.Logging` into the same Player.log-style file
(`~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/Player.log`), with engine messages tagged
`[engine]`. GL debug output is enabled in debug builds. As the original release player does
(UnityProbe's logging scenario), a message of any type (Log, Warning, Error) is written with no
stack trace, and its callbacks get an empty one, although `Application.GetStackTraceLogType`
reports ScriptOnly for each type. An exception gets its own frames, innermost exception first, in
Mono's format (`  at A.B (System.String s) [0x0001f] in <mvid>:0`), then the managed frames of the
`LogException` call in Unity's (`A:B(String)`), the engine's frames left out where the original's
are native (`Engine/LogTraces.cs`). Unlike Unity's, the file is capped at about 60 MB (D36).

Personal paths (`--log-paths hidden`, the default; `LogScrubber`): what goes to Player.log and to
stdout has the profile folder replaced by `%USERPROFILE%` (Windows, any case and slash) or `~`,
the Documents folder outside it by `%DOCUMENTS%`, a SteamID64 path segment (cloud_save_files) by
`<steam id>`, and the user name as a path segment by `<user>`. The rules are built at start-up
from those known values (~2 ms; a Regex of them cost ~10 ms), and a line is scanned only when it
has a slash and one of their words (vectorized searches: ~5 ns a line without a slash, ~35 ns
one with a path that names no one, ~450 ns one with a save path replaced). The
log callbacks (`Application.logMessageReceived*`) get the text as logged: mods and the game's
crash reporter read it there. The console writer holds a partial line until its line break (or a
flush, or other output, which writes it first, so the order stays), so a path written in pieces
is replaced too. The settings are read before the log opens, so its first lines are covered.
The platform layer has no logged-in Steam ID at that point, so Steam IDs are replaced as path
segments only.

Development diagnostics (host options, never needed by players): `--trace-exceptions` logs every
first-chance exception with per-frame IL offsets (the game ships without symbols; the offset
and `ilspycmd -il` locate the throwing instruction); `--capture FRAME:PATH[:SCALE]` writes a
screenshot through `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot`; `--input FRAME:ACTION[:ARGS]` feeds scripted
mouse/keyboard/wheel/text input through the window's input path (held keys for chords such as
Ctrl+F4); `--dump-render-textures FRAME:DIR` writes
the screen and every live render texture as PNG at the end of a frame; `--dump-shader NAME:DIR`
writes a shader's GLCore variants and pass state; `--frame-stats` logs per-phase frame times
and the GPU time per frame (timer queries), any frame over 250 ms with its own breakdown, and every 600 frames the process memory and the managed heap; `--max-frame-rate N[:FRAMES]` bounds the frame rate
(for the first FRAMES frames) so scripted schedules that count frames hold on unpaced displays;
`--probe-ui FRAME:X,Y` logs the canvas elements drawn at a window point with their hierarchy
path, material, texture, colour and group alpha; `--dump-hierarchy FRAME:PATH` logs a subtree's
active flags, rects and components; `--dump-component FRAME:PATH|TYPE` logs a component's serialized fields;
`--report-builtin-assets FILE` writes the objects a run loaded
from Unity's built-in resource files (docs/LICENSING.md); `--check-*` run the corpus gates.
`ONI_OBJECT_CENSUS=N[:MARK]` logs every N frames the live render textures (how many, how many
allocated on the device, their estimated bytes), textures, meshes, materials and sprites, each
against the census at frame MARK; with `ONI_OBJECT_SITES=1` it also lists the creation sites
(the game or mod methods) holding most of the objects made since then: what piles up until
Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets (ObjectCensus).

CPU profiles: `perf record -e cpu-clock:u -g` (user-mode sampling needs no privileges at the
default `perf_event_paranoid` 2) with `DOTNET_PerfMapEnabled=1`; the runtime maps JIT code twice
(W^X), so samples fall in a `memfd:doublemapper` mapping and are resolved against
`/tmp/perf-PID.map` by address. `dotnet-trace`'s thread-time sampling stops threads at GC safe
points and charges the time before a safe point to the method that reaches it (it showed lock
and GC-poll time that perf does not), so it is not used for self time.

## 9. Verification

1. **Conformance:** `tools/ApiCheck` over the consumer set; the count of missing members only
   goes down. Each milestone states which areas must reach zero.
2. **Asset corpus test:** every object in every data file (and in bundles) deserializes to
   exactly its byte size, natives and MonoBehaviours alike.
3. **Unit tests** for math, serialization rules, cloning, lifecycle ordering, coroutine
   semantics, layout of uGUI (via the shipped DLL), shader variant selection.
4. **Headless boot runs** asserting the scene/bootstrap sequence reaches defined checkpoints
   with zero logged exceptions.
5. **Visual checks:** `--capture` screenshots at checkpoints, reviewed against reference
   screenshots of the real game.
6. **Gameplay soak:** new colony → N cycles → save → reload → continue, no exceptions.
7. **Offline Steam test double** (`tools/SteamStub`, `scripts/run-offline.sh`). The game
   requires a logged-in Steam client (`SteamAPI_Init`); on machines without one, test runs
   load a generated stand-in for `libsteam_api.so` through the host's dev-only
   `--native-override steam_api=PATH`. Every entry point Steamworks.NET binds exists and
   returns zero except a small table describing a logged-in owner of the base game (no DLC,
   no Workshop items, English); no callback is ever delivered. It is test infrastructure,
   not part of the product: it lets M4–M6 engine behaviour be exercised; Steam-specific game
   behaviour (DLC ownership, Workshop mods, achievements, cloud) is verified only with the
   real client.
8. **Original-player comparisons on Windows** (`scripts/original-windows.sh`). The original runs
   from a renamed copy of the install with BepInEx 6 and `tools/OriginalIsolation`, which
   redirects the same two known folders our host's `--run-home` does and sends FMOD's output to
   a WAV file; the copy's product name (PlayerSettings) is changed to one of the same length so
   Unity's registry key and LocalLow folder are the copy's own; the Steam double stands in for
   Steam. Both players load `tools/PerfProbe`, a game mod that keeps the colony at speed 3 and
   logs the frame rate from the real-time clock, and resume the save through the game's own
   `AutoResumeSaveFile` setting (`scripts/windows-run-home.sh`), so the same code measures both.
